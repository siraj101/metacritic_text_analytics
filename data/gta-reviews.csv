The storyline is simply ravishing, some of the old graphics glicthes have been repaired and even the aim system has been finally improved.

Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories,78,Cheat Code Central,"Liberty City Stories is a summer time treat for PS2 owners who haven't played the PSP version. Even though it's an almost direct port, the control system is vastly improved on the PS2 and the budget price just seals the deal for this full length GTA adventure.",90,06-Jun-06
Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned,90,Gamers.at,"Numerous new missions, features and a brand new story that is not only intertwined with the original, but also complements to the living spirit of the city.

Grand Theft Auto IV: The Ballad of Gay Tony,89,Gaming Target,"Overall, The Ballad of Gay Tony is an outstanding package offering tremendous value. As an “expansion pack” it offers more gameplay, features and fun than many full-sized retail titles.",95,29-Oct-09
Grand Theft Auto IV: The Ballad of Gay Tony,89,Eurogamer Italy,"Despite some radical style changes for what concerns storyline and mission structure, The Ballad of Gay Tony doesn’t fail our expectations, proving to be an engaging, unpredictable and funny DLC that will undoubtedly assure hours of all-out action to anyone willing to visit Liberty City once more. As for GTA IV, we really couldn’t ask for a better conclusion.",90,29-Oct-09
Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars,91,null,"The controls are unavoidably compromised but this is a whole GTA for 5.99 quid and essential if you haven't been to Chinatown yet. [Apr 2010, p.85]",90,18-Jan-10
Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories,78,GamePro,"LCS is probably as long as most other GTA games, and even without the multiplayer mode that was present on the PSP, this one is well worth the single Andrew Jackson.",85,06-Jun-06
Grand Theft Auto: Vice City 10th Anniversary Edition,80,Multiplayer.it,"Sure, it's not the most comfortable way to explore Vice City, but the low price and high quality of this mobile version are both very good reasons to get back in the shoes of Tommy Vercetti.",90,06-Dec-12

Grand Theft Auto IV: The Ballad of Gay Tony,89,NZGamer,"The Ballad Of Gay Tony is the most enjoyable by simply upping the ante a notch, reminding us that even in a city 'where the money is making the plan', you can still have a little fun.",90,29-Oct-09
Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned,90,Gamer.nl,"There was a lot of buzz around The Lost & Damned, but in the end it was all worth it. The game offers a nice storyline with a couple of pretty decent missions, some entertaining side-missions and a very tasteful multiplayer. But, there remains a little voice in our head that says that Rockstar could have done more, because of the repetitive structure of the missions and a storyline that didn't feel like a real surprise. Still, GTA IV is one of the best games money can buy and is, without a doubt, the best in it's genre.",90,17-Feb-09

Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned,90,Cheat Code Central,"The sheer amount of content in The Lost and Damned is truly impressive considering its modest twenty dollar asking price. With its lengthy single-player experience that provides a good amount of new content, while also shedding light on some of the events of GTA IV, as well as its enjoyable new multiplayer options, it would be impossible to not recommend this title to fans of the series. Hell, the inclusion of checkpoints in every mission throughout the expansion, avoiding the frustration experienced in GTA IV from having to drive back to every mission after failing, is worth it alone.",94,17-Feb-09
Grand Theft Auto IV: The Ballad of Gay Tony,89,null,"Slightly less satisfying than last time around, but only to the tune of being the second-best piece of downloadable content ever created for a console title. Not bad then. [Issue#52, p.84]",90,29-Oct-09
