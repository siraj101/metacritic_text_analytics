It didn’t take much to suck me in though, and it can be an addictive and fun time waster depending on who you roll with. I’ve spent a fair share of time online, and although it’s been slightly shaky here and there, nearly everything that Rockstar Games has promised is more or less working."

20,0,Grand Theft Auto V,100,Game Revolution,"Nov 18, 2014","For most, Grand Theft Auto V and GTA Online will continue to present the same frustrations in place of freedom. There’s no getting around the fact that this open-world game aims to deliver variety, largely does, and yet still steps on a few toes and the sensibilities of responsibly minded Americans.

25,0,Grand Theft Auto V,100,Hardcore Gamer,"Nov 17, 2014","More than just a gimmick, the first-person mode really does change how it’s experienced by adding a new layer of gameplay. It won’t be for everybody, but the sheer fact that the option is there is commendable. More still, multiple new vehicles, weapons and animals have been introduced.

59,0,Grand Theft Auto V,90,The Jimquisition,"Nov 18, 2014","I loved it back then, and I love it now. Its attempts at clever humor can be embarrassingly misjudged, its content is often alarming, and I think those who point out the game’s problematic elements are perfectly within their right to do so, and they’re very rarely wrong. Still, I can accept that the game is troubling while still enjoying it, and the extensive augmentations found within the PS4/Xbox One version makes it all the more pleasant."

100,1,Grand Theft Auto V,95,SpazioGames,"Jun  8, 2015","We could not expect a better PC port PC for Grand Theft Auto V. Rockstar North, offers right from day one a huge game in optimized, widely scalable, and high impact graphics and the video editor, although not so easy to use, is an enjoyable addition."

103,1,Grand Theft Auto V,95,GamingTrend,"Apr 21, 2015",Grand Theft Auto V on the PC takes an already amazing game and makes it better. Every aspect just seems sharper and better than previous releases. This is how all ports should be handled.
104,1,Grand Theft Auto V,95,InsideGamer.nl,"Apr 20, 2015","We have been kept waiting for very long, but GTA 5 for PC really is the best version of the game. It offers the same ingenious story of three characters, plus the online mode with Heists, more music and a very good optimisation. Definitely worth the wait."
105,1,Grand Theft Auto V,95,Hooked Gamers,"Apr 20, 2015","Though it should've come out ages ago, and PC gamers have every right to feel like they were put on the backburner, Rockstar North has tried to make sure that Grand Theft Auto V for PC is the ultimate version.

106,1,Grand Theft Auto V,95,PC Games,"Apr 17, 2015","One and a half years after its initial release for last-gen consoles, you’ve probably heard it before: GTA 5 is one of the best games currently out there. So go ahead and buy it already. Rockstar even did a mighty fine job with the PC port."
107,1,Grand Theft Auto V,95,GRYOnline.pl,"Apr 17, 2015","The PC Verizon of GTA V is almost perfect. The superb base version is well known and loved, but the optimization, controls and new options knock it out of the park. Of course there were some issues with the game after the launch - so many delays should have eliminated these kinds of setbacks and for that the final grade goes down a bit. But when you finally get to play GTA V on your PC you'll be amazed."
108,1,Grand Theft Auto V,95,XGN,"Apr 16, 2015",Rockstar told us the PC-version would be the ultimate version and they were right. GTA 5 on PC looks incredible and it works almost perfectly. Sadly you might still encounter some bugs and glitches in GTA Online that you already saw on the consoles.

120,1,Grand Theft Auto V,90,4Players.de,"Apr 17, 2015",Visually this is the definitive edition of the gangster drama we all came to love (or hate) with all its gorgeousness as well as its little flaws. And with the editor as well as the director mode creative players get all the tools they need.
121,1,Grand Theft Auto V,86,Cheat Code Central,"Apr 15, 2015","In short, GTA V is still a great game, that hasn’t changed, but the PC version doesn’t add a lot and introduces plenty of new problems that you have to contend with. If you are graphics-obsessed or are a fan of machinima, then pick it up. Otherwise, the last-gen versions will do you fine."
122,1,Grand Theft Auto V,70,CGMagazine,"May  1, 2015","If GTAV was more fully devoted to being either a comedy or a drama, its narrative may have been more successful. As it is, the most fun to be had in the game comes almost entirely from the moments when the player breaks away from the mission structure and enjoys the world without worrying about the context of its plot."

124,2,Grand Theft Auto V,100,AtomicGamer,"Oct  7, 2013","Does GTAV live up to one of the pedigree of one of the best franchises gaming? There's no doubt for me that it does, and a few minor issues here and there don't get in the way of this game delivering such a lively and large world to explore or from presenting such an entertaining way to do dozens of activities - and I love that for the first time for GTA in nearly a decade, the developers aren't relying so heavily on mind-numbing, straightforward gunfights with thugs and cops."

I'm going to stay in Los Santos for a while longer, because I still have lots of things to do and see. GTA V is a better version of GTA IV - and is better in almost every way. Rockstar did it again - the game has class, is smart and is constantly entertaining and amazing. It's like a little universe at your fingertips - you have to come and visit.

135,2,Grand Theft Auto V,100,Eurogamer Spain,"Sep 16, 2013","GTA5 does much more than repeat the San Andreas model, introducing many new features in the franchise. From those, the one that adds a whole new dimension to the game is the fact that for the first time we have three main characters instead of one. GTA is the king of controversy... long live the king."
136,2,Grand Theft Auto V,100,LaPS4,"Sep 16, 2013","Grand Theft Auto V is not just the best sandbox game there is. It's not just one of the best 3rd-person shooters ever. It's not just a great action game, a great driving game, and a great piloting or sports game. It's not just the biggest audiovisual spectacle in the last few years. Grand Theft Auto V is the best game in the current console generation, period."
137,2,Grand Theft Auto V,100,JeuxActu,"Sep 16, 2013","What genius. Rockstar Games are still at the top level of open world videogames and they want everybody to know it, especially the rival titles. They will need a lot of creativity and great ingenuity to take the crown from the grip of the king GTA 5. No matter what happens next, a video game has never reached such depth in its gameplay. Gunfights from Max Payne 3, the exploration system from Red Dead Redemption, the driving system from Midnight Club: simply the best from the best. Simply perfect."
138,2,Grand Theft Auto V,100,Gameblog.fr,"Sep 16, 2013","GTA V is in line with our expectations. It offers what we expected: a beautiful and gigantic world, hours and hours of play... but it does it better than ever. GTA V also adds the ability to switch between three different characters, which is really interesting and fun during hold-up sequences. This is a must-have, obviously."
139,2,Grand Theft Auto V,100,Everyeye.it,"Sep 16, 2013","Three incredible characters in a well-driven storyline, a ton of things to do and a ton of fun. GTA 5 is simply the best game of this generation."
140,2,Grand Theft Auto V,100,TheSixthAxis,"Sep 16, 2013","It is engaging, compelling, interesting, clever, funny and packed with things to do and see. It’s a personal story, or several personal stories, set in a magnificent world that ebbs and flows with thousands of people who all seem to be living their own personal stories. It’s a genuine landmark event in the history of videogames."
141,2,Grand Theft Auto V,100,Gamer.nl,"Sep 16, 2013","Pull out the clichés and superlatives, because they’re all applicable. GTA 5 is the ultimate milestone for the series, as well as for gaming as a whole. When it comes to scale, detail, character, freedom and spectacle this generation of consoles has reached its absolute peak. It doesn’t trump The Last of Us or BioShock: Infinite in the form of emotional impact, but there’s no other game out there that does this much this well."
142,2,Grand Theft Auto V,100,Vandal,"Sep 16, 2013","It's the best and the biggest sandbox ever made. The story and how it's told, the deep world around us where there's always something happening, and the amount of content and things to do, make it the perfect closure for this generation."
143,2,Grand Theft Auto V,100,Thunderbolt,"Sep 16, 2013","Part of what makes the game so generally appealing is that, for the most part, it drops the nagging feeling of “good for an open world game.""...Grand Theft Auto V is a good shooter and a good driving game with responsive character control. While some of the extras might be spread a little thin, there are no compromises with these central mechanics, which is a feat for a game of this breadth."
144,2,Grand Theft Auto V,100,GameWatcher,"Sep 16, 2013",If a picture is worth a thousand words then the game itself is a novel every city block and every dusty trail.

145,2,Grand Theft Auto V,100,PlayStation LifeStyle,"Sep 16, 2013","If anyone is still wondering if GTA has lost its ability to take on the politically correct about ‘appropriate’ content, do not fear, as it is full of violence, social commentary and explicit nature that is sure to aggravate someone with too much time on their hands."
146,2,Grand Theft Auto V,100,Playstation Official Magazine UK,"Sep 16, 2013","There’s simply more here than in any game before, and yet quality is never sacrificed for quantity. Personal favourites will persist, but it’s hard to put anything else on top of the pile. Everything you’ve ever wanted a GTA game to be, and a whole lot more. Consistently hilarious, constantly compelling and combining never-before-seen scale and ambition. This is going to make next-gen look bad for a long time to come."

148,2,Grand Theft Auto V,100,Eurogamer Italy,"Sep 16, 2013","Rockstar shows one more time how to build a masterpiece. GTA V is not perfect but has everything you'll ever dream in a sandbox game. San Andreas is gorgeous and full of life, Trevor, Michael and Franklin are a trio full of charisma and the game simply raises the bar in so many aspects you won't believe that it runs on an eight years old hardware. It's worth your money, it's worth you time."
149,2,Grand Theft Auto V,99,GamingXP,"Sep 25, 2013","With a swan song to the aging console generation Rockstar once again shows us what Open World really means.

150,2,Grand Theft Auto V,98,Official PlayStation Magazine Benelux,"Oct  1, 2013","GTA IV was extraordinarily good, but it took itself a little bit too seriously.

151,2,Grand Theft Auto V,98,XGN,"Sep 19, 2013","Grand Theft Auto V is the magnum opus of the current generation.

160,2,Grand Theft Auto V,95,PSX Extreme,"Sep 19, 2013","Grand Theft Auto V is a gargantuan accomplishment, with an emphasis on the word “gargantuan.” It may still have an assortment of inconsistencies, idiosyncrasies and eccentricities, but one could argue that such missteps still give this franchise a singular character."
161,2,Grand Theft Auto V,95,GamesBeat,"Sep 16, 2013","Time just melted away as I lived a second, third, and fourth life in GTA V. The experience consists of more than just crimes. I played tennis, enrolled in a flight school, captured fugitives, watched movies, and towed cars.

164,2,Grand Theft Auto V,93,GameFront,"Sep 24, 2013","Grand Theft Auto V is a remarkable achievement.

171,2,Grand Theft Auto V,90,GameSpot,"Sep 16, 2013","GTA V is an imperfect yet astounding game that has great characters and an innovative and exciting narrative structure, even if the story it uses that structure to tell is hobbled at times by inconsistent character behavior, muddled political messages and rampant misogyny. It also raises the bar for open-world mission design in a big way and has one of the most beautiful, lively, diverse and stimulating worlds ever seen in a game."
172,2,Grand Theft Auto V,80,Shacknews,"Oct  7, 2013","Grand Theft Auto 5 is easily more likable than its predecessor, striking a better, more consistent tone than GTA4.

Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in."
180,3,Grand Theft Auto V,95,CD-Action,"Feb  7, 2015","Rockstar did not have to try hard – GTA V would sell on new consoles even it was the same game as before.

187,4,Grand Theft Auto V,100,Quarter to Three,"Oct 15, 2013",The primary accomplishment in Grand Theft Auto V isn’t gameplay. It’s character. Grand Theft Auto V believes so strongly in its characters that everything else — even gameplay — is secondary.

When you love it nothing else matters."
191,4,Grand Theft Auto V,100,Game Revolution,"Sep 20, 2013","Rockstar Games have unleashed the Skyrim of third-person action games. It'll have a lasting impact through controversy, through harshly addictive gameplay, and by taking the zeitgeist of 18-36 year-old males hostage and torturing them with nipple clamps."
192,4,Grand Theft Auto V,100,LevelUp,"Sep 19, 2013","With Grand Theft Auto V Rockstar has delivered one of the most amazing and awe-inspiring games of this generation. Even if you are not a fan of the series, the incredible level of detail, the three main character switching mechanic, the bank heists and the hilarious story make this game a must."
193,4,Grand Theft Auto V,100,EGM,"Sep 17, 2013","Grand Theft Auto V expertly blends the best aspects of the last two major releases in the series, GTA IV and San Andreas, to set a new standard in open-world action. In a year already packed with titles that have pushed aging console hardware to new extremes, GTA V might stand as the crowning technical and design accomplishment."
194,4,Grand Theft Auto V,100,X-ONE Magazine UK,"Sep 16, 2013","GTA V is funny, genuinely laugh out loud funny – and not in a ’shoving a ten-inch purple dildo up your arse’ funny – the humour is told through situation, through incredibly clever writing and wonderful sense of place. Really, that says everything you need to know about GTA V. Rockstar has spent five years, and an insane amount of money, building a game that is not only bold enough to step away from expectation, but brave enough to revel in its combined history as well."
195,4,Grand Theft Auto V,100,Gameplanet,"Sep 16, 2013","Grand Theft Auto V is the pinnacle of the franchise and of gaming in 2013.

Rejoice, for Rockstar North has done it again."
196,4,Grand Theft Auto V,100,God is a Geek,"Sep 16, 2013","Make no mistake: this game is beyond heavyweight. In many ways, Grand Theft Auto V is a culmination of the current generation; it’s a summation of everything we’ve seen in the last eight years, a love letter, if you like, to the 360 and the PS3."
197,4,Grand Theft Auto V,100,Telegraph,"Sep 16, 2013","Grand Theft Auto V is the pinnacle of open-world video game design and a colossal feat of technical engineering. It takes a template laid down by its predecessors and expands upon it, improving on and streamlining some of its rougher aspects. It doesn’t break out of that template and can be brash, nasty and nihilistic. But for all its more unsavoury aspects, this is a game built with skilled mechanical expertise and creative artistry."
198,4,Grand Theft Auto V,100,Guardian,"Sep 16, 2013","The genius of GTA V is in the sheer seductive force of its vision. The visuals are astonishing – just astonishing. Surely pushing this ageing hardware to the limits, we get the dense downtown with its soaring skyscrapers and murky, rubbish-strewn back alleys. But then out into the country, we have rolling grasslands and desert stretches, coyotes roaming, the shadows of eagles swooping overhead...The world drags you in. It begs you to explore – and then it rewards you."
199,4,Grand Theft Auto V,100,SpazioGames,"Sep 16, 2013","When analyzed in its purest essence, GTA V not only proves to be an excellent title, but also a game that is able to make a sublime parody of today's society, taking advantage of all the excesses and insanities to which the world is slowly getting used."
200,4,Grand Theft Auto V,100,3DJuegos,"Sep 16, 2013","GTA V is not only bigger and funnier than the amazing Niko Bellic’s tragedy, it's also better. With a ton of mission variety, amazing visuals and fantastic gameplay, this is the biggest game ever made."

202,4,Grand Theft Auto V,100,Machinima,"Sep 16, 2013","Getting through the main story in a timely manner was a challenge in itself, but in that time I found that GTA V was possibly the most well-paced open world game I have ever played. I never felt like I didn’t have something to do and as of right now, I’m going right back in to do it all over again. I’ve been with GTA since the beginning way back in ‘97, and it feels like GTA V is the culmination of everything we love about the series: It’s big, it’s pretty, and most importantly it’s just nonstop fun."
203,4,Grand Theft Auto V,100,Digital Spy,"Sep 16, 2013","With a great cast, a huge list of missions and activities, some novel new gameplay additions and one of the most stunning environments we've ever explored, Grand Theft Auto 5 is a masterpiece and a hugely impressive technological achievement."
204,4,Grand Theft Auto V,100,GamesRadar+,"Sep 16, 2013","The world is massive and detailed, the gameplay is damn near perfect, and though there are some lackluster side missions, the actual story is filled with memorable personalities that feel more fully-realized than even the best of GTA's previous characters."
205,4,Grand Theft Auto V,100,games(TM),"Sep 16, 2013","Sam Houser compared the making of Rockstar’s epic to the troubled production of Francis Ford Coppola’s Apocalypse Now, and in some ways the same result has been met: a product that represents the peak of the blockbuster triple-A form, that realises grand ambition without visible compromise."
206,4,Grand Theft Auto V,100,Eurogamer Germany,"Sep 16, 2013","The fifth game in the series combines the delusions of grandeur facilitated by the most detailed open world to date to super-solid shooting and driving mechanics. Previous lengths have been traded in for a consistently captivating narrative which not only holds everything together, but really makes this game seem more than the sum of its parts. The only remaining question is: Where will – or can –the series go from here? I am looking forward to finding out."

208,4,Grand Theft Auto V,100,IGN Italia,"Sep 16, 2013","The quality of GTA V puts to shame 99% of triple A productions. The story is beautiful, the graphics are unbelievable for the old hardware they run on, and most importantly the gameplay is fun and smooth. GTA V is not afraid to show it is a videogame, and has the guts to trade some of its realism for the sake of fun."
209,4,Grand Theft Auto V,100,Gamereactor Denmark,"Sep 16, 2013","GTA V feels like a next-gen game without actually being one. If all the other studious could do what Rockstar can, there'd be plenty of life left in the current console generation. But that's the thing, isn't it. No other developer is like Rockstar. And no other series is like Grand Theft Auto."
210,4,Grand Theft Auto V,100,Meristation,"Sep 16, 2013","GTA V represents the videogame at its finest. Tense and dramatic when it wants, joyful and surprising when the player wants it.

211,4,Grand Theft Auto V,100,Metro GameCentral,"Sep 16, 2013",A staggering technical achievement that is matched only by the depth and ambition of its gameplay – this is not only the best-looking GTA ever but by far the most fun to play.
212,4,Grand Theft Auto V,100,VideoGamer,"Sep 16, 2013","Unless you play it for yourself, it's near impossible to grasp how big GTA 5 is. It's not just the world. It's the gargantuan story, the sheer amount of missions and the variety introduced with them, the activities to take part in, or the secrets waiting to be unveiled. It's a highlight of the generation."
213,4,Grand Theft Auto V,100,Hardcore Gamer,"Sep 16, 2013",It features arguably the best story of the series that’s greatly enhanced by the added dynamic of three contrasting protagonists.
214,4,Grand Theft Auto V,100,IGN,"Sep 16, 2013","Grand Theft Auto V is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game, but also an intelligent and sharp-tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA IV brought to the table five years ago."

Definitely – and it’s quite possibly the best video game yet. I say this after playing it for “only” 20 hours.
218,4,Grand Theft Auto V,100,Edge Magazine,"Sep 16, 2013","No one makes worlds like Rockstar, but at last it has produced one without compromise. Everything works. It has mechanics good enough to anchor games of their own, and a story that is not only what GTA has always wanted to tell but also fits the way people have always played it. It’s a remarkable achievement, a peerless marriage of world design, storytelling and mechanics that pushes these ageing consoles to the limit and makes it all look easy."
219,4,Grand Theft Auto V,100,Gamer.no,"Sep 16, 2013","Grand Theft Auto V is one of the best sandboxes that video games have to offer.

Beyond the game’s story line you’ll be able to put in hundreds of hours just wandering the city streets and never be bored doing so.

225,4,Grand Theft Auto V,98,ActionTrip,"Sep 25, 2013","Grand Theft Auto 5 defines what we want out of a free-roam action game. It also outshines all of its predecessors in every possible way, because it perfects the familiar formula and takes it to new heights."
226,4,Grand Theft Auto V,98,GameTrailers,"Sep 16, 2013","For the anarchist, GTA5 is quite a playground. The entire map is available once you get through an hour or so of the story, and the tools of destruction are numerous and hugely enjoyable, although some of them might need to be unlocked first. The Gatling gun returns and a gas canister spills a solid line of flammable justice waiting to be set off. Guns can be painted up and modded with flashlights, grips, scopes, and suppressors."
227,4,Grand Theft Auto V,98,AusGamers,"Sep 16, 2013","The standout factor for Grand Theft Auto V is that each character not only offers a unique perspective on the GTA world in which you’re taking part, but on gaming as a whole. Franklin is new to the ‘game’ -- he looks sharp and listens and learns. Michael is as I’ve painted him to be: a reluctant master in an ever-changing dojo clinging to a wall of arbitrary yet important-to-him trophies, while Trevor is the wild side in every gamer (thanks Joab) -- the sort of yes-man we inevitably become because pain and reward exist on a blurred precipice in modern narrative-driven gaming."
228,4,Grand Theft Auto V,98,Game Informer,"Sep 16, 2013","The narrative fails to match the impact John Marston or Niko Bellic's tales, but the colorful characters kept me interested in the story nonetheless.

233,4,Grand Theft Auto V,95,GamingTrend,"Sep 16, 2013","I can’t imagine the pressure behind the scenes, but everything that Rockstar has attempted with Grand Theft Auto V gels together perfectly. As we look forward to the next-generation launches in just a few months, it’s pretty awesome to see the best game of this entire generation cap it off."
234,4,Grand Theft Auto V,95,Polygon,"Sep 16, 2013","Rockstar has expanded and improved upon so much of what's special about video games as mainstream spectacles, from the playful use of characters to the refined take on world design. The developer's progress makes the aspects of the game left in cultural stasis — the poorly drawn women, the empty cynicism, the unnecessarily excessive cruelty — especially agitating."
235,4,Grand Theft Auto V,94,Riot Pixels,"Oct  7, 2013","The most amazing thing about this criminal saga is not only its scale, but that it perfectly works on several levels. Spine-tingling driving, fun missions, excellent dialogue, fully fleshed characters, vicious satire on pretty much everything… One play-through is not enough to appreciate GTA 5 in all its multi-layered glory."
236,4,Grand Theft Auto V,90,Toronto Sun,"Sep 30, 2013","Its problems range from finicky little things like twitchy helicopter flying controls to much larger issues, such as unsettling bits of cruelty that don’t always register as satire, or the still-unsolved challenge of maintaining any sense of plot urgency in a game where players are free to abandon the storyline and spend hours skyjacking blimps, tooling around in a submarine or taking in-game smartphone selfies and posting them online."
237,4,Grand Theft Auto V,90,Critical Hit,"Sep 25, 2013","Despite all these accomplishments and additions though, GTA V isn’t a huge leap forward for Rockstar. Instead, it’s an evolution of all their previous work, all combined into one sandbox experience on a massive scale. But it’s a satisfying path that the franchise has taken, kicking other genre games off the throne that it helped build."
238,4,Grand Theft Auto V,90,Gamer Limit,"Sep 16, 2013","Although it does suffer from a few problems that have plagued the franchise since the beginning, the improved driving controls, captivating leads, and the sprawling city of Los Santos should win the hearts of any open world fan out there."
239,4,Grand Theft Auto V,90,Joystiq,"Sep 16, 2013","An ambitious game, attempting to meld three very different characters together to tell one encompassing story of survival in what amounts to the worst place in America. That story stumbles, but the open-ended gameplay remains a showpiece for the vast amount of content that can be poured into a virtual world."
240,4,Grand Theft Auto V,90,Destructoid,"Sep 16, 2013","All three characters, in their respective ways, feel representative of the Grand Theft Auto series as a whole, and contribute to making GTA V what it is -- the ultimate culmination of Rockstar's beloved and despised series."
241,4,Grand Theft Auto V,85,Post Arcade (National Post),"Sep 24, 2013","When you’re dealing with disturbing subjects ranging from life-destroying drug addiction to creepy cult organizations to legitimately psychopathic behaviour, the jokes go down a little easier if you get the sense that the writers penned their quips with an aim to make you think about why you’re laughing...True satire happens in Grand Theft Auto V, just not nearly as often as I’d like."
242,4,Grand Theft Auto V,80,Level7.nu,"Dec 12, 2013","Grand Theft Auto V offers one of the best sandbox experiences ever,
filled to the brink with stuff to do. The vistas are magnificent and
amazing stuff just seems to happen wherever you go. But at the same
time the story is tired and the characters unoriginal. Your
appreciation of Grand Theft Auto V will depend of what you want out of
the series. The freedom and joy of discovery is hard to beat but
the rest still has some ways left to go."
243,4,Grand Theft Auto V,80,GameCritics,"Oct  3, 2013","Even with as many downs as ups, Grand Theft Auto V is still a significant achievement in design. Playing missions from multiple perspectives is a creative spark that will surely light up the next generation, and I'm confident the Housers have even bigger ambitions. They'll keep building upon this template and inch tantalizingly closer to creating their perfect game. GTA5 isn't it, but its flashes of brilliance will endure."
244,4,Grand Theft Auto V,70,The Escapist,"Sep 16, 2013","It is the difference between The Godfather Part 1 and Part 2, between Inglorious Basterds and Triumph of the Will, and between Just Cause 2 and JFK Reloaded. In the former examples, the audience can get behind the anti-heroes depicted for whatever reason and condone their admittedly awful actions, but in the latter group, the subject matter or the protagonist's morals are skewed too far from the norm to be comfortably witnessed. That's what it's like to play Grand Theft Auto V. The three men you take control of throughout the game aren't even anti-heroes. They're just scumbags."

The sounds still hold up and have aged well and there is longevity with these titles as they are brilliant when functioning. I have faith they will continue to update and fix issues, but game developers are getting away with dropping broken games and fixing it later. The delay for the physical releases being pushed back to the 17th shows that they want more time to fix them. The digital launch was a beta test at best and we were the guinea pigs to experiment with. Wait for the inevitable updates to slowly roll out before giving your money to a game company that wanted to swindle loving fans at launch.

It's hard not to think about the games that this trilogy would inspire--stuff like Mafia, Saints Row, Yakuza, Sleeping Dogs--and how well each of those series have been preserved and updated.

365,57,Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition,60,NME,"Nov 15, 2021","GTA: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition feels far from the ultimate version of these great games right now. Three magnificent open-world adventures have been made available on modern consoles, and they feel much better to play than ever thanks to a set of mechanical tweaks, but the visual overhaul has summoned scores of new problems that make the package difficult to recommend in its current state. Newcomers without nostalgia could still find a lot to love in this collection, but you’d be much better off waiting for patches and updates that will hopefully bring the Trilogy up to scratch so that it can reflect the enduring brilliance of the source material."

In spite of the flaws it can still be a fun nostalgia trip for old fans or a good way for newer fans to discover the games before Grand Theft Auto V, but between the dated mechanics and inconsistent visual performance, Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – Definitive Edition is far from perfect."

Almost all of the enjoyment I got from the game stemmed from the gameplay of the original itself."

The technical restyling on the three chapters of the saga was half successful but does not pay the right homage to the original trilogy, while the improvements to the gameplay are not enough to make us forget the many bugs and glitches of this unsuccessful collection."

Ultimately, a shoddy visual upgrade, choppy performance, and a lack of meaningful updates or extras may leave you questioning why you loved them in the first place. Perhaps this collection can be brought up to snuff with updates from Rockstar (or modders), but for now, its Wanted Level remains low."

Both PS5 and Xbox Series X offer users the best chance of brute-forcing past the performance barriers but, even then, occasional bugs and glitches can occur. Fun can be had on those current-gen systems, especially by those with some sentimental attachment to the original trilogy, but there’s still likely to be moments of frustration."

When you consider all of the possibilities or additional improvements that could have been made, it just feels like Rockstar could have gone further and created some truly memorable remakes or high-quality remasters. All of the games here do look better and play better than the originals, which technically does make these versions the definitive ones, but it feels like a missed opportunity at the end of the day. A few patches will likely take care of some of the more obvious issues, but at this point it is hard to recommend to anyone other than the GTA faithful."

Which is simply a testament to how well-written the Grand Theft Auto series is. The GTA: DE needs a patch. Or, maybe, it needs a boatload of patches. Though, I still find myself enjoying the over-the-top storylines, ridiculous dialogue, and outrageous mission structure. It’s hard to call these definitive, but still easy to call them classics."
378,57,Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition,50,Push Square,"Nov 18, 2021","All three mainline GTA games from the PS2 era are seminal pieces, and they still hold up to modern scrutiny – the outstanding GTA San Andreas especially. But as remasters these are weak: they chug on modern hardware and are undone by questionable artistic decisions. Rockstar built its reputation on attention to detail, and while all three of these games still come highly recommended, this disappointing compilation will go down as a stain on the label’s record."

The few updates made with controls, shooting, and lighting are nice, but not enough to justify the $60 price tag. The games are still worth revisiting, especially if you’ve never played the original releases, but only if you aren’t playing on PC or the Switch as those versions seem to share the bulk of issues the game is currently experiencing. So far PS5 is the way to go for a hassle-free trip into Liberty City, just maybe wait for a price cut first."

New features are slight and only partially implemented, visuals are mixed, performance is inconsistent at best, some content is missing, and bugs and glitches abound. In its existing state, this collection of three classic GTA games is far from being considered definitive; it’s defective, disappointing, and surprisingly disrespectful to both the legacy of the games themselves and their many legions of fans."

The new graphic design and the few gameplay modifications sound like cover for the pile of bugs and problems that completely distort the original material. A mirror to the lures sold at an exorbitant price considering its proposal and still unavailable for PC players at the time of closing this review."

Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition does not provide the best way to experience these titles, nor should this be considered the ""definitive"" edition of the games included. The Definitive Edition is often prettier and slightly more modern in its controls and presentation, but missing features and poorly optimized content let down what could have been ideal remasters. Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition feels rushed - and after twenty years, that's disappointing."

At times it seems that Rockstar Games didn't even bother to oversee the work of Grove Street Games. There are some moments and small details that lead one to think that an algorithm was responsible for remastering the graphics and that no human reviewed the final product. GTA deserves more.

Don't get me wrong, the games themselves remain great, but the updated (camera) controls and some graphical updates are far from being able to compete with all the missing content and the numerous graphical misses that this collection makes. This makes Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The (So Called) Definitive Edition feel like a lazy cash grab that Rockstar Games should be ashamed of."

All the points are there to let a new generation of players enjoy these games - warts and all. However, what we really have is an insult to the legacy of these games, to fans of the series and the word Remastered. These ports should be avoided unless you're a diehard fan. Because these games always had a level of jank that you could put up with, and those fun games are still here if you fight through the pain. But for anyone else, trust that GTA 3, Vice City and San Andreas were terrific games and play their legacy in everything else they inspired instead. I don't think there are any amount of patches that can help the Switch version of this Trilogy."

However, seeing the state of Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition, there just isn't any way to let Rockstar off lightly here. This is one of the most successful video game companies in the world, with goodness knows how much raked in from GTA Online, so there can be no excuses to have loaned out these iconic games to a small team with a poor track record and showing absolutely no respect for its own creations. Fifty pounds is a big ask for such old games that have been what one might say ""demastered"", and even with numerous future patches, these may never be the upgrades they should have been, but Switch owners new to this trilogy can find plenty of entertainment - and not just because of the glitches. This is still a hard sell, though, with the advice being to hold off for a major sale."

This is a poor port, a shoddy, stuttery, low resolution mess full of bugs, glitches, audio problems and more besides. If can grab this one on any other platform, we'd advise you do so or, at the very least, hold off until it's been patched and hopefully improved in the future.
