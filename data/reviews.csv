1,0,Disco Elysium: The Final Cut,100,Shindig,"Jun 18, 2021","Disco Elysium – The Final Cut is something rare. It’s a re-issued version of an already-beloved game, that manages to eclipse the source material through clever and thoughtful additions that maximise one of the game’s most beautiful assets: its prose. But more than that, it’s the only CRPG that can truly claim to emulate the tabletop experience—not through adherence to statistics or rules or character sheets, but through the simple act of asking questions, and thoughtfully incorporating the answers."

3,0,Disco Elysium: The Final Cut,100,GameSpot,"Apr 15, 2021","A fully voiced cast and new content of comparable quality to the original game are welcome additions, although The Final Cut isn't quite yet the definitive edition we were hoping for due to the nagging issues it suffers from.

Its twisting plot, cast of memorable characters, and sheer depth of choice combine to create an experience that begs to be savoured. It hits on every single one of the marks it sets out to achieve and left me yearning to spend more time in its world. Removing any of the minor gripes I had with the original by adding new quests and a full cast of well-voiced characters, The Final Cut elevates Disco Elysium from an already phenomenal RPG to a true must-play masterpiece."

In the game, it is the end of the tale of Hydaelyn and Zodiark, the Ascians, and the Scions of the Seventh Dawn who rose to challenge them. In our universe, it is the end of the second era of Final Fantasy XIV, a midnight that transitions into a bright and new day for the players and developers, in which anything could happen. But for now, the clock is still striking twelve, and I’m absolutely thrilled to see what will happen at 12:01."

This is a story you’ll be thinking about for years to come."
16,1,Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker,98,RPG Fan,"Jan 18, 2022","Wrapping up a story is never easy, even in a single-player game. Wrapping up a near decade-long arc and meeting the high bar set by previous expansions is even more difficult, but Endwalker manages both with aplomb. Even with the promise of a new adventure on the horizon, I was still sad things were over when I reached the end credits and immediately wanted to start a replay. By my reckoning, this is the sign of an exceptional, unforgettable experience, and I enthusiastically recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest in FFXIV."
17,1,Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker,95,Gamepressure,"Feb  9, 2022","FFXIV is currently the best MMORPG available. The main reason is because it’s RPG first, MMO second. The story isn’t just an afterthought, but an integral part of the experience, and everything else revolves around the tale of the Warrior of Light. It’s logical, well-planned, and presented with great, voiced (or not) cut-scenes."

We’re desperate to see where the title goes next, but if you need us, you can find us leveling those new jobs."
20,1,Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker,95,MMORPG.com,"Dec 22, 2021","[Endwalker] is a lofty, ambitious epic that ties together story threads, characters, and powerful themes in a way that only a story so trusting of its players can pull off. It’s not perfect, but Endwalker’s tale feels so authentically conveyed, even despite how big FFXIV has become, that many players will feel like it might as well be."
21,1,Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker,95,Easy Allies,"Dec 16, 2021","Endwalker exudes excellence. The minor shortcomings pale in comparison to the sheer magnitude of its achievements. It’s one of the most ambitious MMO expansions ever made, and a magnificent conclusion to a journey that boasts some of the best storytelling in this medium. Those harboring reservations about the time commitment should carefully consider that you’re missing out on one of the best experiences in gaming.

24,1,Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker,90,Windows Central,"Jan 19, 2022","Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker is a fantastic expansion that pays homage to the series' legacy and is a beautiful send-off to a ten-year-long story arc. The plot me had engaged throughout its entirety, the characters are memorable, and the new dungeons and Trials are satisfying to conquer. While some Job changes could be improved with future patches, many of them are welcome additions to the game."
25,1,Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker,90,Gamer Escape,"Jan  3, 2022","It’s obvious that Endwalker is going to be a favorite of many Final Fantasy XIV, while for others, it might not have hit that high bar that was raised with Shadowbringers. Regardless, Endwalker is still a fantastic addition to a game that was originally one of the worst received in the series. It truly is the comeback story of video gaming. Naoki Yoshida and his team should be commended for the incredible amount of world building and story telling that they’ve been able to pull off for, now, over ten years. Final Fantasy XIV continues to be a game that we would recommend everyone experiences. That is, as soon as the game stops being so popular that it’s able to resumes sales."

28,1,Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker,90,Inverse,"Dec 17, 2021","Endwalker may not outdo the previous expansion, Shadowbringers — a high point for the entire Final Fantasy series — but it ultimately has very different aims. Even as it ends the game’s first story arc, it has me looking forward to what’s next. For all its lofty ambitions, this operatic conclusion to a decade-long story peaks when focusing on how its core characters keep each other standing, even as the world falls down around them."
29,1,Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker,90,Hardcore Gamer,"Dec 15, 2021","It’s something that delves deep into the existential question regarding life and death, and our reason for living under suffering. It also goes in an immensely different direction, one that it felt impossible to see coming. This is all enhanced thanks to the original soundtrack that goes well beyond what we could have hoped for, immersing us in a tale we will never forget. That’s not to say there aren’t flaws, though, as there’s a few moments throughout the campaign that felt like padding, and some of the solo instances, as creative as they may be, killed the flow of events. This is on top of a good chunk of gear being reused assets. Thankfully, all of this pales in comparison to the rest of the adventure, witnessing one of the most well-written RPG stories ever told. Truly, Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker is like nothing you’ve ever experienced before, in an MMO or otherwise."

31,1,Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker,90,Jeuxvideo.com,"Dec 15, 2021","With Endwalker, Final Fantasy XIV definitely proves that it deserves its place in the pantheon of the best episodes of the saga. It's simple, this new expansion brilliantly succeeds in concluding the narrative arc of Hydaelyn and Zordiarche thanks to strong moments sublimated by dungeons and epic challenges. Despite a rhythm that knows a few lengths, the adventure provides many satisfactory answers and benefits from visually successful environments as well as a high-end soundtrack that allow us to forget the dated technique inherent in this kind of game. extension which therefore does not include any major new features, but rather additions such as new jobs and many more than welcome adjustments. Now, we can't wait: to find out what Naoki Yoshida and his teams are preparing for the next patches and the future of Final Fantasy XIV."
32,1,Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker,90,Cubed3,"Dec 14, 2021","Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker caps off the Hydaelyn and Zodiark saga in a near perfect fashion. The storytelling on display vastly outshines the hit or miss quest design. The English voice acting deserve praise for consistent performances of both old and new characters backed by great directing. The dungeons and trials are some of the best in the game that continue to offer escalating challenges while keeping to consistent visual language. Each zone has a unique visual style and tale to tell in this final chapter, despite one or two having a rather slow introduction. All rounded out by a masterwork soundtrack, this MMORPG continues to prove that it shouldn't be missed."
33,1,Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker,89,PC Gamer,"Dec 10, 2021","It's impressive that the team is still able to take FF14's trappings and crystalise them into new forms even so many years on, from the way jobs and dungeons feel like the best they've ever been, to their confidence when it comes to experimenting with the relationship between gameplay and storytelling. But while there are some stunning vistas and lighting effects, and the detailing on new armour designs are enchanting, the age of the core game can't help but show, smooth as it is to play. This is a great final chapter to a story that'll stick with me, and I'm excited to see the team tell a new one—but I'm eager for some bigger changes to shake up Eorzea when they do."

35,1,Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker,80,Het Nieuwsblad,"Jan 20, 2022","It sounds contradictory, but the new storyline is both the ultimate asset and the great weakness of the game. After all, Endwalker builds on a story that has been going on for eight years. To fully understand and experience everything, you need all that background. Endwalker is the pinnacle for existing players of Final Fantasy XIV, but not so accessible for new players who only now want to catch up. And that gets in the way of an absolute top score."
36,1,Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker,80,Siliconera,"Dec 29, 2021","Ultimately, Final Fantasy XIV Endwalker marked the end of an era. Plot threads from A Realm Reborn onward come to a close. The story is rife with fanfare, paying homage to past expansions in ways that sometimes feel overmuch or hit in just the right way. While the story isn’t as effective as it could be, the combat adjustments and quality-of-life improvements make Endwalker a strong expansion."
37,1,Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker,80,GameSpot,"Dec 21, 2021","For all that Endwalker suffers from pacing issues and the sheer amount of plot lines it lobs at us, an earnestness carries the entire story. Endwalker is jubilant in its sincerity, and tender in the way it treats life and death, mankinds' inevitable failing and flaws. It doesn't shy away from grand proclamations that would come across as cheesy if it was any other game, with any other cast of characters. But because it's FFXIV and because the Scions are people who accompanied us through Ala Mhigo's revolution, averting the apocalypse on the First, and much more, Endwalker's loud and bold demands for hope, light, and love fall more on the endearing side rather than hamfisted sentimentality. Endwalker is a fitting, emotional conclusion to a years-long journey for us adventurers, and I can't wait to see what's next."
38,2,Forza Horizon 5,100,Het Nieuwsblad,"Dec 20, 2021","The graphics, lighting and weather effects are some of the best we've seen in a racing game, but of course it's all about the cars. Although this is an arcade racer that does not focus on realism but rather on short and fast action, the cars behave truthfully and react differently whether you are driving on a track, on the street or off road. The controls have been kept simple, making the game accessible to just about anyone. Altogether, this makes Forza Horizon 5 the most fun racing game of the moment."
39,2,Forza Horizon 5,100,PC Invasion,"Nov  4, 2021","Forza Horizon 5 is a masterclass example of how to do an open-world racing game, bar none. Thanks to its deeply rich map, wealth of content, and fantastic visuals, it's the best racing experience I've had yet."
40,2,Forza Horizon 5,95,LevelUp,"Nov  5, 2021","Forza Horizon 5 is the racing game for everyone, which takes outsiders from the racing genre and turns them into followers of the speed, and for those who are already fans, it offers an almost endless variety of activities and challenges. Also very remarkable is the representation of Mexico, which offers vibrant landscapes full of incredible details that only those who live in Mexico will recognize. It is an indispensable game and highly recommended."

Go anywhere, do anything, just don’t skip this stellar game."
42,2,Forza Horizon 5,95,Wccftech,"Nov  4, 2021","Forza Horizon 5 is yet another step up for the series and arguably the best racing game ever made. Offering a host of content across a fantastic representation of Mexico, its varied terrain and scenery, there's so much to explore and race. A massive roster of cars will perform all of these, each feeling different from the others, with a variety of upgrade and tuning options almost matching those of simulation titles. While there are a few minor niggles here and there, they are nearly so small as to be hardly worth mentioning. All in all, it's impossible not to recommend this for anybody, regardless of them being a fan of racing games or not, as this is that good."
43,2,Forza Horizon 5,95,Jeuxvideo.com,"Nov  4, 2021","¡Ay, caramba! Forza Horizon 5 is maturing under the Mexican sun a recipe concocted by Playground Games that has already delighted millions of pilots. Like an antojito, Forza Horizon 5 can be enjoyed in a good mood with anyone, anytime. Rolling over everything that has already been technically done and taking advantage of the Xbox Series X springboard to stamp the skies, Microsoft's software climbs the volcano of fun and unleashes an exhilarating torrent to be experienced alone or with others. It’s the festival of the decade."

It promises and delivers an incomparably customizable driving experience, with dream-cars, in breathtaking landscapes."

Playground Games has been getting it right for a decade now. This is the definitive experience in the series so far, one that excels both on PC and the Xbox Series X. Minimal issues, such as server connectivity, fail to spoil the party that is just crammed with happiness and adventure. A number of small improvements across the board elevates the racer to being best in class; a huge plus for Microsoft with Sony’s impressive-looking Gran Turismo 7 flashing its headlights not too far in the distance."
47,2,Forza Horizon 5,90,PCGamesN,"Nov  8, 2021","Familiar, excellent, and polished to a degree that hardly seems possible. If you love taking vintage Porsches for joyrides through environments that’d have a poet bawling then you're going to be very happy here."
48,2,Forza Horizon 5,90,MGG Spain,"Nov  4, 2021","Forza Horizon 5 is a formidable game, with a spectacular graphics and an overwhelming amount of content. But above all, it is a fun title that dignifies the fun in video games with no greater pretension than that, to have the best time possible."
49,2,Forza Horizon 5,90,Hardcore Gamer,"Nov  4, 2021","Forza Horizon 5 is undoubtedly a visual showcase and technical benchmark for PC and Xbox Series X owners. If you have the hardware to run this game on PC, this is the choice to make."

51,2,Forza Horizon 5,90,PC Gamer,"Nov  4, 2021","Playground's singular series gets a lush new setting, but otherwise remains committed to tuning an already winning formula. But even a marginal improvement on the best racing series around is worth celebrating."
52,2,Forza Horizon 5,90,Gamepressure,"Nov  4, 2021","While Forza Horizon 5 launches with a score of ""only"" 9.0, it has potential for even more. All Playground Games have to do is to eliminate bugs and bring back some missing cars, which could be done in a few months, with several updates. What about a perfect 10/10? It would require a multitude of further improvements to AI and physics. But perhaps Forza Horizon 6 will achieve that. I surely hope so, as this would give us the perfect racing game."
53,2,Forza Horizon 5,90,PCMag,"Nov  4, 2021","With Forza Horizon 5, the racing series makes its first stop in Mexico. It delivers breathtaking vistas, fast action, and the hook: the new EventLab mode that lets the community create cool, custom challenges."
54,2,Forza Horizon 5,90,Shacknews,"Nov  4, 2021","The detour into Mexico is a sight for sore eyes after a three-year stay in the rather dreary United Kingdom of Horizon 4. Innovation is about the last thing you’ll find on the Forza Horizon 5 buffet, but there is no denying that this is the best software available for Microsoft’s Series X|S consoles and, for people who have strong PCs, the best reason yet to pony up for a 4K 120Hz HDR display."
55,2,Forza Horizon 5,85,Gamers Heroes,"Nov  4, 2021","Forza Horizon 5 is still an incredible racing game, one only overshadowed by the brilliance of its predecessor.

Chicory: A Colorful Tale is a game about self-exploration, frequently presenting earnest themes that can be challenging to engage with given how relatable they can feel. But it's also an exercise in confronting these insecurities and barriers that prevent you from enjoying what you put out into the world and rediscovering its importance in the process.

74,3,Chicory: A Colorful Tale,85,Jeuxvideo.com,"Jun 27, 2021","Under its thick features and its childish airs, Chicory shelters very tough challenges. Together, creator Greg Lobanov (Wandersong) and composer Lena Raine (Celeste) have managed to shape a universe generous in exploration, discovery and obstacles to overcome, offering a completely correct lifespan. If you don't want to take the time to solve the ingenious puzzles that present themselves to you, you will have the leisure to get involved freely in the other small quests of the adorable world of Picnic, populated by its charming animals. On the other hand, let's repeat it, the adventure will be much better if you opt for the keyboard."
75,3,Chicory: A Colorful Tale,85,Noisy Pixel,"Jun 16, 2021","Chicory provides an earnest and genuine adventure full of fun puzzles, charming characters, and cute aesthetics. With a surprisingly deep and impactful storyline, the game delves into realistic themes that may hit more than you think. Though controls are clunky and there’s a level of monotony to the painting, Chicory seamlessly weaves comfort and emotions into a strong narrative adventure."
76,3,Chicory: A Colorful Tale,85,Wccftech,"Jun 11, 2021","Chicory: A Colorful Tale is an ambitious, absorbing, and creative Zelda-style adventure with some meaningful, heartfelt things to say about the creative process, self-doubt, and other big issues. Like its characters, Chicory isn’t perfect – its controls can be a bit clunky and maybe its painting tools aren’t as versatile as they could be – but it’s an easy game to love. Does it fall slightly short of masterpiece status? Perhaps, but it’s still very much worth adding to your art collection."
77,3,Chicory: A Colorful Tale,85,The Indie Game Website,"Jun 11, 2021","Chicory flits through its hours of play with earnest, effortless charm that admittedly verges on saccharine at times—some of its townsfolk seem more like caricatures than actual personalities—but it has also helped me to appreciate the heights and mundanity of exploration, discovery and creation. It’s something I haven’t quite been able to for a while in games."
78,3,Chicory: A Colorful Tale,82,Vandal,"Jun 16, 2021","Chicory is a beautiful adventure, that could improve its level design, but compensates for its small flaws with everything else."
79,3,Chicory: A Colorful Tale,80,CD-Action,"Sep  1, 2021","I never thought I’d enjoy a game where drawing and coloring are gameplay’s core elements. Don’t let the seemingly infantile graphics fool you, because Chicory is much deeper and more serious than you might think. Or rather can be, because it’s for you to decide whether you want to delve into the deeper, darker layer of the game and uncover the therapeutic power of art in the fight against depression. If you don’t, you still get a weird, unusual and very enjoyable mix of an adventure game, a puzzle game, some platforming elements and a coloring book. [09/2021, p.30]"
80,3,Chicory: A Colorful Tale,80,Meristation,"Jun 13, 2021","Chicory achieves exactly what it intends: to absorb you into its universe and dazzle you with its structure. A brush as a magic wand capable of painting, solving puzzles and answering many of the questions it asks you. Excellently localized and with an unforgettable soundtrack, its only problem is the control with the controller, which is not as comfortable as it should; it is more accurate with a mouse on PC. Finji has once again succeeded in turning simplicity into an advantage. Its puzzles are intelligent, there is always a surprise waiting for you in its beautiful story. One of the indie surprises of 2021."

It’s a fantastic experience that will stick with you, and has a ton to see and do."
83,4,Psychonauts 2,100,NME,"Aug 23, 2021","After a long sixteen years, Double Fine has delivered the ultimate sequel. Psychonauts 2 refines what made the first game good, ponders necessary questions, expands a world that was begging for a follow-up and executes a number of jaw-dropping visual ideas. It’s a proper modern 3D platformer with incredible art direction, and it’s ready to hit you with a deluge of imagination and empathy. You don’t want to miss it."

86,4,Psychonauts 2,95,GameGrin,"Aug 23, 2021","Psychonauts 2 is an absolutely fantastic game, and I can say that with certainty. Double Fine took an amazing concept that was ahead of its time and proved that they could do it again. The very few issues I had with the game were minor and had absolutely zero bearings on my overall enjoyment of the game."
87,4,Psychonauts 2,95,Wccftech,"Aug 23, 2021","Psychonauts 2 delivers on everything it madly promises. That includes old school platforming with new school precision, an impressive visual style that never falters, and a world begging to be explored."
88,4,Psychonauts 2,94,The Games Machine,"Aug 23, 2021","The very existence of Psychonauts 2 demonstrates that good ideas have to overcome a thousand difficulties before being realized, but in the end they somehow impose themselves. It took years for the first chapter to overcome people’s skepticism but, day after day, it has built up a fan base so large that we were finally able to play with a full-fledged, high budget sequel. And it's beautiful. Pleasant, original, colorful, compelling. Do you need more adjectives to be convinced?"

90,4,Psychonauts 2,90,GameWatcher,"Aug 31, 2021","It boasts some of the most imaginative levels out there, and they’re backed up by platforming and combat that feels very familiar yet also surprisingly fresh. Its story has a more personal note, yet fleshes out not just Raz and the characters around him, but the game’s universe as a whole. Simply put, Psychonauts 2 is a triumph in all the ways it needs to be, and this hopefully means that it won’t be the last we see of the series."

93,4,Psychonauts 2,90,IGN Portugal,"Aug 23, 2021","Psychonauts 2 is a brilliant experience that makes the 16-year wait since the first game worth. Creativity is the key, in a title that offers one of the best audio-visual experiences of the year. Expectations were high, but Double Fine corresponded to the fans expectations with a game that follows the formula of the first, while adding a series of improvements and features that make it a must for any fan of the genre."
94,4,Psychonauts 2,90,Trusted Reviews,"Aug 23, 2021","Psychonauts 2 is a fun, endearing puzzle platformer full of quirky challenges and entertaining dialogue. If you’re a fan of the original, or just enjoy platformers, Psychonauts 2 is a great purchase. The only downside is that its graphics and combat mechanics can feel a little outdated."
95,4,Psychonauts 2,90,PCGamesN,"Aug 23, 2021","A rare sequel that improves on the original in every meaningful way. It's packed to the brim with beautiful worlds and surprising interactions, and its colourful cast is equal parts funny, believable, and sympathetic. Double Fine is rarely wide of the mark, but this time it hit the bullseye."
96,4,Psychonauts 2,90,GameByte,"Aug 23, 2021","Playing Psychonauts 2 is like taking a step back in time in the best way possible. The fact that the game’s core concept still holds up 16 years later is a testament to how far ahead of its time the first game was. Psychonauts 2 feels like it’s the game Double Fine always wanted to make. It incites a childlike, playful nature that I’ve not experienced in games for ages. At the same time, it deals with some heavy subject topics in ways that feel nuanced. Even if you haven’t touched the original, Psychonauts 2 is absolutely worth playing through."
97,4,Psychonauts 2,90,Checkpoint Gaming,"Aug 23, 2021","Psychonauts 2 is absolutely fizzing with ideas in gameplay, story, and presentation. Its story is emotional, its characters are hilarious, its worlds are huge and imaginative, plus I had a fun time actually playing the dang thing. Apart from some minor issues with the optional dialogue, it's clear Double Fine went all out developing this title. Nothing feels rushed, nothing feels unfinished, and nothing feels like padding. This is a fabulously well-made game, and a perfect game for lockdown. If you’re looking for some extra joy from your video games, you need to play Psychonauts 2. If you’re a fan of the original, I suspect you’ll like it even more."
98,4,Psychonauts 2,90,Screen Rant,"Aug 23, 2021",Psychonauts 2 is a must-play for anyone interested in what modern platformers can do and what a compelling comedy adventure looks like in 2021.

100,4,Psychonauts 2,89,MGG Spain,"Aug 23, 2021","Psychonauts 2 is huge news for Xbox Game Studios, Double Fine, fans of the series and gamers in general. It's a title that overflows with charisma and deals with some very complicated issues in a brilliant way. Perhaps we could have asked for more from a gameplay or combat point of view, but it's impossible not to have a smile on your face when you reach the credits."

105,4,Psychonauts 2,85,Game Revolution,"Aug 23, 2021","Platformers have technically advanced a lot since the original Psychonauts, though they’ve never really grown up. Despite animated films from the likes of Pixar addressing depression, grief, and even dementia for a younger audience, games rarely explore hard-hitting topics in a way that’s palatable for kids. Psychonauts 2 not only does a terrific job of exploring mental health without the confrontational heaviness of the M-rated The Last of Us 2, while diving in deep enough to warrant lengthy conversations about its themes long after its credits have rolled. While its old-school nature can lead to frustration, I was far too enamored by its characters and their heart-warming empathy for one another to let it dampen my enjoyment of this long-awaited sequel."
106,4,Psychonauts 2,85,Jeuxvideo.com,"Aug 23, 2021","If one feels the mechanics of the old-school 3D platformer at the heart of the structure of Psychonauts 2, the reunion with Raz has never been so modern and pleasant. Funny, touching, ultra creative, more precise in its gameplay than before, Psychonauts 2 is a generous and rhythmic game, which offers between 15 and 20 hours of a particularly successful experience. Certainly, we will deplore a challenge in withdrawal, bosses perhaps less crazy than in the past or the absence of French dubbing, but nothing to sulk his pleasure in the face of this breathless, funny and touching adventure located in a universe that it is so refreshing to explore."
107,4,Psychonauts 2,82,Game World Navigator Magazine,"Oct 22, 2021","Every detail in the game shows that, despite the 17-years gap between the original game and its sequel, Raz still holds a very special place in the hearts of Tim Schafer and his team. [Issue#255, p.48]"
108,4,Psychonauts 2,82,Areajugones,"Aug 23, 2021","Psychonauts 2 is an act of empathy by Double Fine towards video games and oneself. If you are ready to go through it, this sequel can put aside its appearance of a classic 3D platform video game to connect with you on a very personal level. Or, at least, that's what happened to me while i was playing it. Psychonauts 2 has come like a breath of fresh air at a time in my life when I needed to stop for a moment and just breathe."
109,4,Psychonauts 2,81,New Game Network,"Aug 31, 2021",Fantastic trips through colorful minds and a robust narrative help to make Psychonauts 2 an enjoyable adventure and a faithful sequel.
110,4,Psychonauts 2,80,Slant Magazine,"Aug 25, 2021","If so much of this game is a reiteration of what worked about its predecessor, it functions as a reminder for just how much of the medium is still catching up to Psychonauts."
111,4,Psychonauts 2,80,Malditos Nerds,"Aug 23, 2021",Moments will leave you with a lump in the throat or others that are really funny; brilliant musical sections and realistic and tender romances; tributes to amusement parks and reflections on addiction or on our own fears. Few games know how to navigate that range of emotions so well without getting lost in the attempt. Psychonauts 2 achieves all that and much more.
112,4,Psychonauts 2,80,Destructoid,"Aug 23, 2021","A huge impact was left on me by Psychonauts. While that’s not likely to be the same story for Psychonauts 2, I wasn’t disappointed. There was no single place that let me down so severely that it soured the overall experience. Nothing that struck me as starkly inferior. It’s maybe not quite as genius, but it’s still a mind worth exploring."

While the free goodies are undoubtedly welcome, it’s the extra characters, Survival mode and moves offered by Mr. X Nightmare that really breathe new life into this magnificent side-scrolling beat ’em up. With the DLC installed, Streets of Rage 4 becomes one of the best gaming experiences you can have right now. It’s utterly essential. Now we’re just hoping that Dotemu, Lizardcube and Guard Crush get to work together again on Streets of Rage 5."
116,5,Streets of Rage 4: Mr. X Nightmare,100,Screen Rant,"Jul 15, 2021","Anyone who’s been looking for a better reason to go back to Streets of Rage 4 than just crawling up the leaderboards should jump on this DLC release, and the Survival mode’s 2-player online capability provides a great excuse to bring a friend along for the ride."
117,5,Streets of Rage 4: Mr. X Nightmare,95,Gamers' Temple,"Jul 27, 2021","Mr. X Nightmare makes Streets of Rage 4 a near perfect beat’em up. At this point, Streets of Rage 4 is the game to judge all other beat’em ups by from now on. Mr X Nightmare is not even a cherry on top, it’s like getting an extra cake to go along with the first cake (the main game). The DLC is also available at a bargain price – only 1/3 the cost the of the main game itself, so it’s a steal. If you have Streets of Rage 4 and want to breath some new life into it, buy the Mr X Nightmare DLC and you’ll be playing it for quite a while. The survival mode alone will keep you busy for quite a while so just that mode alone is worth the purchase."
118,5,Streets of Rage 4: Mr. X Nightmare,90,Ragequit.gr,"Jul 22, 2021","There may not be any groundbreaking improvements in the graphics/audio aspects, but the gameplay enrichment is so apt and entertaining that it raises impressively the overall value of the game. Therefore, if you enjoyed Streets of Rage 4, there is no reason not to get this DLC, which, thanks to the new characters and Survival mode, is capable of keeping you busy for many hours."
119,5,Streets of Rage 4: Mr. X Nightmare,90,God is a Geek,"Jul 19, 2021","Streets of Rage 4: Mr. X Nightmare offers three new fighters that all offer something different, and a great new mode in Survival."
120,5,Streets of Rage 4: Mr. X Nightmare,90,Digital Chumps,"Jul 19, 2021","With the Mr. X Nightmare DLC, SOR4 feels fresh all over again. The new characters, moves, and weapons make replaying through the campaign with friends a treat, and the Survival Mode offers an intense barrage of enemies to beat with interesting gameplay elements. At just $8, it’s easy to recommend the DLC, but if you’re a fan of physical media, there is a fresh re-release of the game that includes the DLC on the medium, too. Regardless, Streets of Rage 4 is not to be missed, and this DLC is worth adding to an already stellar game."
121,5,Streets of Rage 4: Mr. X Nightmare,85,TierraGamer,"Jul 29, 2021","Thanks to the Mr. X Nightmare DLC, Streets of Rage 4 feels fresher, more challenging and with more options to enjoy a game that already felt complete.

122,5,Streets of Rage 4: Mr. X Nightmare,85,GamingTrend,"Jul 15, 2021","Mr. X Nightmare is loaded with enough new content to keep players engaged or bring back those who may have strayed. As an old school fan, it’s great to have Max back but the new faces fit into the roster nicely and bring their own beautifully animated flair to the party while survival mode provides plenty of replay value."
123,5,Streets of Rage 4: Mr. X Nightmare,85,Noisy Pixel,"Jul 15, 2021","Streets of Rage 4: Mr. X Nightmare DLC exceeded my expectations, adding to an already fantastic game. The new characters and weapons deliver a unique experience, and the survival mode can keep you playing for hours. On top of that, the price is exceptionally reasonable for what you get. If you are a fan of beat ’em ups, this is one DLC that shouldn’t be passed up."
124,5,Streets of Rage 4: Mr. X Nightmare,80,Jeuxvideo.com,"Jul 21, 2021","The Mr. X Nightmare expansion reinforces Streets of Rage 4's staple position by correcting rare errors in the original game. It expands the base game's cast with three new heroes (including two dedicated primarily to beginners), adds a Training mode accessible to all and a new mode: Survival. This new proposal with high replayability comes with game mechanics inspired by roguelite, the bosses of the first opus, a brand new musical playlist that fits perfectly to the universe and new environments, even if we can regret a lack of variety on this side. But this is the only big problem with this first DLC. Despite this and to put it simply: Mr. X Nightmare perfectly complements the original work and it will please fans of the genre."
125,5,Streets of Rage 4: Mr. X Nightmare,70,Hey Poor Player,"Jul 15, 2021","Streets of Rage 4 continues to be everything you would want from a modern beat ‘em up. With excellent controls, smooth gameplay, beautiful animation, and a stunning soundtrack, it is well worth your time. For existing fans, nothing in the Mr. X Nightmare DLC is going to blow your mind. This isn’t a huge addition. It’s a bonus, some new content to push you back into the game. It won’t change anyone’s opinion about the game as a whole, but if you already enjoy raging through these streets, these new characters and survival mode are great additions."
126,6,It Takes Two,96,The Games Machine,"Mar 24, 2021","It Takes Two is absolutely stellar. Extremely varied, never boring, fun and exciting to play, incredibly pretty and with great character writing. If you enjoy cooperative play, you owe it to yourself to play it."

128,6,It Takes Two,95,Gamersky,"Mar 30, 2021","There is no doubt that It Takes Two is one of the best two-person cooperative games in recent years. From the moment I entered this wonderful world, I was bombarded by senses from all aspects throughout the game and shocked this masterpiece of creativity and imagination. The only question is, to Josef fares and Hazelight, this is the summit or just a good beginning?"
129,6,It Takes Two,95,PC Invasion,"Mar 24, 2021","A fantastic presentation buoyed by constantly enjoyable, varied gameplay and wonderful level design make It Takes Two a must-play for fans of platformers. And even anyone who's ever wanted to play a Pixar movie."
130,6,It Takes Two,95,MGG,"Mar 24, 2021","Let's not be afraid to say that It Takes Two is one of the best cooperative games available: the new Hazelight hits the nail on the head every time, with numerous, varied and always very inventive situations. The pace is so fast that not half an hour goes by without the title integrating a new mechanic or propelling you into a new environment, for a constantly renewed gameplay pleasure. Not to spoil anything, the sublime art direction and the endearing duo formed by Cody and May sweep away its few flaws, which are more of a quibble than anything else. A killer-app, that we warmly recommend to you."
131,6,It Takes Two,93,Everyeye.it,"Mar 24, 2021","Despite some occasional and physiological qualitative fluctuations, the title always remains at excellent levels, continuing to testify to the strength of a game design as imaginative as it is effective, enhanced by a great artistic direction that enhances the merits of the story at the center of the campaign."

133,6,It Takes Two,90,IGN Portugal,"Mar 30, 2021","It Takes Two is a journey through a magical world, expertly crafted with the greatest of affections. There is not a single dull moment along the journey, which is full of humorous moments, a dash of mom and dad rivalry and a cast of characters that manage to be memorable, even with short appearances. The puzzles are imaginative, the action is fluid and the experience is a must."
134,6,It Takes Two,90,PC Games,"Mar 25, 2021","It Takes Two is brimming with creative ideas, diverse gameplay and a touching narrative that fits the overall theme.

135,6,It Takes Two,90,IGN,"Mar 25, 2021","It Takes Two is a spectacular co-op adventure that lays down a path of great gameplay ideas and uses it to play a giddy game of hopscotch. It’s beautiful, breakneck-paced, and bubbling over with creativity, and playfulness and experimentation are rewarded at every turn. If you have any kind of co-op partner in your life, be they spouse, friend, sibling, or other (even a child, though the themes might be too mature for them), It Takes Two is a truly joyful trip you really need to take together."
136,6,It Takes Two,90,GameSpot,"Mar 24, 2021","It's impressive stuff. It Takes Two is the best 3D platformer I've played since Super Mario Odyssey, and like that game, it has a flair for variety. You may ride a frog or fly a plane with wings made from Cody's boxers or hack-and-slash through a Diablo-style castle. Despite the downright wild amount of things to do, It Takes Two manages to handle every mechanic well. This is the second release from Hazelight, and while A Way Out had plenty of fans, it seems that it may just take two to make a thing go quite this right."

142,6,It Takes Two,80,Telegraph,"Apr  7, 2021","Tonally it is all over the place, never seeming quite sure what type of game it wants to be and audience it wants to court. At times it as sweet, warm and sharply enjoyable as any family film. May and Cody’s jibes at each other swerve from affectionate to cutting in a believable and often touching way as they pick at the rifts in their relationship. You may even start to root for them, until the game swerves into a task involving the excruciatingly drawn-out murder of a toy elephant to make their daughter cry."
143,6,It Takes Two,80,GRYOnline.pl,"Mar 24, 2021","It Takes Two is a terrific game, albeit one that's hard to recommend without a certain mindset. 3D platformer enthusiasts sure won't be disappointed. And if they look for unique ways to cooperate with other players, they've just found an excellent proposition. But the narration is a different beast; a much weaker one. It's definitely a step down compared to A Way Out."

When taken as a whole, the World of Assassination trilogy is hands-down one of the best and most complete-feeling trilogies in video game history. It’s a fitting finale for 47 – at least for now – and it has naturally left me thrilled to see what IO does with James Bond or whatever else comes next. It might only be January – but I can pretty much guarantee this will end the year as one of my 2021 favourites."

If the best Hitman missions for you were those based on freedom, exploration and watching the surroundings carefully, Hitman 3 is what you need. It is a worthy finale of an exceptional trilogy. [03/2021, p.30]"
151,7,Hitman 3,90,Game Debate,"Feb 10, 2021","Predictably enough, I loved it. I loved the stories, the variety in approach, the focus on concluding the trilogy in a (mostly) satisfying way. I loved the literary and cinematic influences. I really like IOI's commitment to ' backwards compatibility' - unlock a sniper rifle in Hitman 3, and sure! You can go back and shoot people with it in Hitman 1. I occasionally get frustrated with the way that the online mode features can be a little unforgiving on a poor internet connection. But overall this is a game I'm sure I'll still be dipping into for years to come, just as I have with the previous two. It's the best action shooter series out at the moment for sure."
152,7,Hitman 3,90,Ragequit.gr,"Feb  4, 2021","A must-buy for fans of the Stealth genre, and a safe bet for those looking for a well-crafted third-person escapade that combines solid gameplay with high-quality, movie-like production values."

154,7,Hitman 3,90,MMORPG.com,"Jan 22, 2021","Hitman 3 defies every expectation I had for it, from the size of its maps to the scope of its missions. I am truly free to approach these jobs however I wish, so long as the objectives are met, and that freedom is downright exhilarating. It’s not without its foibles, the inconsistency with its enemies being one that I ran into, but any issues are easily overcome by the quality of the overall experience. This may be 47’s last hurrah for a while, but dang if he doesn’t go out swinging."
155,7,Hitman 3,90,PCMag,"Jan 21, 2021","Five years after kicking off Hitman's new era, IO Interactive closes out the World of Assassination trilogy in spectacular fashion. Hitman 3 is a massive package full of fantastic new levels and modes that's well worth the purchase for stealth-action fans."
156,7,Hitman 3,90,The Digital Fix,"Jan 20, 2021","While the game does not offer anything new in terms of gameplay, Hitman 3 features the best levels in any Hitman game to date."
157,7,Hitman 3,90,PC Games,"Jan 20, 2021","Hitman 3 is the epic finale for the reboot trilogy, which started 2016. The different locations are breathtaking and long term satisfying. The game includes also two of the best Hitman missions of all the time. Dartmoor and Berlin are different to any other previous scenery and really amazing to play. A profound and dark story rounds off this great stealth adventure. There is only one big weakness in Hitman 3 and that’s the annoying and chunky gun handling."
158,7,Hitman 3,90,GRYOnline.pl,"Jan 19, 2021",Hitman 3 surprised me a little and offered more than simply a rehearse of the same good-old stealth action. The solid foundation was complemented by really diverse missions and a strong storyline - a great game became even better. IO Interactive has certainly just delivered the best installment in the rebooted series.
159,7,Hitman 3,90,GameMAG,"Jan 19, 2021","There's simply not a lot of stealth-action games that can hold a candle to Hitman III, with its hours upon hours of engaging gameplay and high replayability. The sheer variety of different locations and missions, and also the inclusion of all the legacy content, turns this title into something you don't want to miss at the start of 2021."

162,7,Hitman 3,90,IGN,"Jan 19, 2021","Rich, rewarding, and highly replayable, Hitman 3 is a superb instalment of IO’s idiosyncratic but much-loved stealth series. The fundamentals haven’t changed since 2016 but its collection of outstanding maps makes for a refined, reliable, and robust curtain-closer to the current Hitman trilogy."
163,7,Hitman 3,90,The Games Machine,"Jan 19, 2021","Hitman 3 dances asymptotically with the concept of perfection, often approaching it without ever really grasping its essence. Nevertheless, IO Interactive manages to improve and refine a well-established formula, while offering a a truly satisfying conclusion to 47’s struggle against Providence. Although there are some flaws, they’re almost entirely eclipsed by the incredible quality of everything else."
164,7,Hitman 3,90,Gameblog.fr,"Jan 19, 2021","Could IO Interactive have ended the World of Assassination Trilogy better? Probably not. Even if Hitman 3 sticks to previous episodes formula and plays it safe, keeping its usual flaws, it offers gorgeous and incredibly well-conceived destinations that will indeed please fans. There are so many good trails to follow, so many possibilities that you'll sure end up with the urge to try everything in order to go for the perfect kill. If you own Hitman 1 and Hitman 2, there is some serious amount of challenges waiting. A PlayStation VR ? Prepare for a game-changing experience."
165,7,Hitman 3,90,Shacknews,"Jan 19, 2021","It’s great on its own, but combined with Hitman (2016) and Hitman 2 it helps make up the masterpiece that is the World of Assassination trilogy"
166,7,Hitman 3,90,GAMINGbible,"Jan 19, 2021","Hitman 3 features both some of the best missions of the series so far and, with the bundled older levels, you get all the other standouts included. Which is a rough way of saying this is the best way to play the Hitman series as well as being an essential new Hitman game in its own right."
167,7,Hitman 3,90,PC Gamer,"Jan 19, 2021","A beautiful, deep, and endlessly replayable murder sandbox, featuring some of the best levels in the series."
168,7,Hitman 3,90,Game Informer,"Jan 19, 2021","Hitman 3 concludes a chapter in the greater Hitman story, but it doesn’t feel like an ending. There’s an  abundance of content and side activities on offer, and the trilogy as a whole is bound to be a long-term destination for would-be assassins. IO Interactive’s final act in the trilogy anticipates and rewards player experimentation, features meticulous level design, and has moments of ghoulish catharsis that makes me cackle aloud. My enthusiasm for it all is as indelible as the barcode tattooed on the back of Agent 47’s head."
169,7,Hitman 3,90,GameSpot,"Jan 19, 2021","What's good about Hitman--its level design and the creativity, experimentation, and exploration that affords--is great in Hitman 3. It closes out the trilogy by brilliantly playing off everything that came before it, making use of and then subverting expectations, and rewarding players for their willingness to master the complexity of both its individual levels and the series as a whole."
170,7,Hitman 3,90,Screen Rant,"Jan 19, 2021",Hitman 3 is the best of the newer Hitman games and quite possibly the best Hitman game in the franchise.

172,7,Hitman 3,90,GamesRadar+,"Jan 19, 2021","A slick and entertaining conclusion to a trilogy full of inventive, beautifully crafted levels to explore and exploit."
173,7,Hitman 3,90,Noisy Pixel,"Jan 19, 2021","Hitman 3 builds on the structure of its predecessors but doesn't recycle old mechanics. Its creative sandbox systems encourage multiple playthroughs with possible outcomes only limited by your imagination. Returning fans will get the most of this narrative as it ties up a few loose ends but doesn't totally stick the landing. It's absolutely brilliant in execution, though, as you replay missions for different results providing the most robust experience to those who spend the most time playing."
174,7,Hitman 3,89,TierraGamer,"Mar  5, 2021","Finishing a trilogy successfully in any entertainment medium is not an easy task in videogames. However, IO Interactive managed to close the new story of Agent 47 in a remarkable way. Maybe it did not offer new gameplay mechanics, it even removed modes from past installments, but the level design did bring a new depth to Hitman III that we had not seen before. Without having to change the usual Hitman formula, IO Interactive gave us in Hitman III a game with replay value, challenges to overcome and content in the short, medium, and long term that will surely extend its life way after launch."
175,7,Hitman 3,88,SpazioGames,"Jan 19, 2021",Hitman 3 is an amazingly crafted epilogue for the World of Assassination trilogy and the best modern Hitman yet.

177,7,Hitman 3,86,GAMES.CH,"Mar  3, 2021","Whether it’s the great scenario design packed with routes and opportunities, the well written story missions, the many funny surprises, the attractive presentation or the motivating reward system - Hitman 3 combines familiar strengths with some new ideas like the shortcut system and the sadly PlayStation exclusive VR mode. Still, Hitman 3 is not free from criticism. This mainly concerns AI quirks, smaller logical errors and missing PlayStation Move controls in VR."
178,7,Hitman 3,85,ZTGD,"Feb  3, 2021","Despite the less than stellar final mission and instability of the servers, Hitman 3 is a worthy entry to bring the World of Assassination trilogy to a close. While it’s uncertain where Agent 47 will go from here, I feel the series is in good hands and I’ll be sure to have my Fiber Wire handy for the next contract."
179,7,Hitman 3,85,Gamersky,"Jan 31, 2021","Hitman 3 is slow and intriguing. Its real interesting point is the enchanting sense of substitution, and the stealth gameplay method is amazing."
180,7,Hitman 3,85,Merlin'in Kazanı (Turkey),"Jan 29, 2021","Hitman 3 is a great finale for the World of Assassination trilogy. With VR support exclusive to PlayStation, it is definitely a game you shouldn't miss."
181,7,Hitman 3,85,Game Revolution,"Jan 19, 2021","The bald, barcoded assassin has had many hits in his 21-year career, but even though it might be his last for quite some time, Hitman 3 is one of 47’s best executions yet."
182,7,Hitman 3,85,MGG,"Jan 19, 2021","Hitman 3 brings the World of Assassination trilogy to its climax thanks, among other things, to more gameplay options. If we would have appreciated more polished cinematics, the in-game graphics meet the expectations and very few bugs are to be deplored. As for the crowd management, it still amazes us, despite the inevitable routines of the NPCs. As for the sandbox aspect, it remains one of the strong points of the title, which will delight the fans eager to experience the numerous possibilities offered."
183,7,Hitman 3,85,Power Unlimited,"Jan 19, 2021","I have been enjoying Hitman 3 so much that I probably won't be playing anything else in the coming weeks, to be able to discover every nook and cranny in the different levels. You do notice that at the end of this trilogy, the concept is getting a bit pale and it is time for Agent 47 to get a makeover. Nevertheless, this is a very big end to the series that will undoubtedly be in my top five at the end of this year."
184,7,Hitman 3,85,Multiplayer.it,"Jan 19, 2021",A solid and powerful final act of the trilogy.
185,7,Hitman 3,85,PC Invasion,"Jan 19, 2021","Although there are a few issues (namely with its save system and soon-to-be-fixed progress carry-over function), Hitman 3's mission stories, level design, and creative assassinations provide the franchise's ""greatest hits"" record. It's the perfect way to cap off Agent 47's journey."

187,7,Hitman 3,85,JeuxActu,"Jan 19, 2021","HITMAN 3 concludes the trilogy started in 2016 in style, on almost all points. The level design shows itself as always brilliant, while the scenario really makes things evolve. This new iteration can also be a valid entry point for new gamers."
188,7,Hitman 3,84,GameStar,"Jan 19, 2021","For me, the bill (with the exception of the story) works out perfectly. In Hitman 3, I have so much to puzzle, lure, assassinate, and giggle while setting up the perfect bitter traps that I will likely spend many weeks with the game."
189,7,Hitman 3,80,Riot Pixels,"Jan 26, 2021","IO Interactive finished its trilogy with a great finale, and this episode is the best of three, tying up the epic World of Assassination series in a beautiful bow."
190,7,Hitman 3,80,GameCrate,"Jan 19, 2021","Hitman 3 was a fun game, but I definitely put it down quicker than I did Hitman 1 or 2. If you wanted more of the same it gives you that on top of being a really convenient platform for the content of the previous games, but that doesn’t change the fact that this feels much more like an expansion pack than a new entry in the franchise."
191,7,Hitman 3,80,Digital Trends,"Jan 19, 2021","Hitman 3 is a great swan song to a fun trilogy of games, held up by its intricate locations and humorous gameplay. Hopefully future updates bring some important additions that extend its replay value and turn it into the ultimate stealth game it is within spitting distance of being."
192,7,Hitman 3,80,Everyeye.it,"Jan 19, 2021","Agent 47, smarter and more lethal than ever, comes back with a gaming experience that knows how to highlight the players’ killer instinct.

193,7,Hitman 3,80,PCGamesN,"Jan 19, 2021","Another fine outing for Agent 47, and a fitting, hopefully brief, farewell to one of the best stealth series of the last decade."
194,7,Hitman 3,80,TheGamer,"Jan 19, 2021","In an alternate universe, Hitman became one of the best-selling series of all time, its influence akin to something like PUBG. In this better world, where the pandemic never even happened, Hitman spawned a genre of its own - the Hitmanlike, where developers put level design and systemic play right at the top of their priority list. Alas, we can’t break through the skin of the world and reach that universe. We’re stuck here. In our world, Hitman stands alone. There’s nothing like it, and Hitman 3 is an outstanding refinement of that unique 21-year-old recipe. Just watch out for that secret ingredient. (It’s poison)."
195,7,Hitman 3,80,VGC,"Jan 19, 2021","IO continues its tug of war between Hitman: The Story and Hitman: The Assassin Simulation. For the most of Hitman 3 the latter wins out and delivers classic hit after classic hit. Wobbly conclusion aside, it’s a must for existing fans and a great introduction to gaming’s boldest, baldest stealth series."
196,7,Hitman 3,80,DualShockers,"Jan 19, 2021","New levels, new targets, new graphical improvements, same Hitman taste. Hitman 3 won't be everyone's cup of tea, but the niche should be extremely satisfied."
197,7,Hitman 3,80,Eurogamer Italy,"Jan 19, 2021","A great epilogue for the World Assassination Trilogy. The inclusion of the prequels updated with the current engine and the variety of missions, will keep you playing past the end. Great graphics and very apt sound compartment."
198,7,Hitman 3,80,IGN Italia,"Jan 19, 2021","A nice conclusion to the World of Assassination trilogy. Hitman III is ""just"" more of the same, but that's not a problem when the original material is that good."
199,7,Hitman 3,70,Slant Magazine,"Jan 24, 2021","Hitman 3 is another attempt on the part of the series to split the difference, for better and worse, between player freedom and focused storytelling."
200,7,Hitman 3,70,Stevivor,"Jan 19, 2021","Hitman 3 is a fun game — and I enjoyed plotting my way through it — but my hopes of refinement and iteration weren’t met. At its core, the gameplay is still the same as it’s always been. The series hasn’t managed to keep up with the times with the only attempt to shift the gameplay formula up somewhat, Hitman: Absolution, being very poorly received."
201,7,Hitman 3,70,Comicbook.com,"Jan 19, 2021","Hitman 3 isn’t a game that I would call bad in the slightest, but it hasn’t done a lot to wow me out of the gate. It feels more like an expansion than a showy, new sequel. Still, even with a handful of drawbacks, the promise is there that this will only continue to be a game that grows and gets better over time."
202,8,Wildermyth,100,Guardian,"Jul  5, 2021","It’s been a while since I’ve played a game that fostered such gentle intimacy between characters – and there’s cooperative multiplayer, too, if you fancy recruiting real-life friends as fellow adventurers."
203,8,Wildermyth,90,Multiplayer.it,"Sep 30, 2021","Wildermyth is more a story and a travel between generations than a game. If you love to read a lot and live and build your own legacy, Worldwalker Games' first game is a must have."

205,8,Wildermyth,90,Metro GameCentral,"Jul 22, 2021",A revolutionary approach to storytelling and an excess of charm makes this modest little indie game one of the most important new role-players of the new generation.
206,8,Wildermyth,90,IGN,"Jul 16, 2021","Indie RPG Wildermyth aims to combine the best of storytelling with the best of procedural generation and succeeds, thanks to great writing, solid tactics, and some very clever design decisions."
207,8,Wildermyth,90,The Indie Game Website,"Jun 24, 2021","On the whole I’m incredibly impressed with Wildermyth. While I was skeptical at first about whether its procedurally-generated narrative events and choices would allow for cohesive character development, its stories are so well-written, funny, and relatable that it’s hard not to be invested in the lives of your motley crew of heroes. Wildermyth is the kind of game that moves seamlessly between heroes making bad jokes one second and reflecting on the nature of existence the next. This tapestry of moments feels appropriate in a game about what it means to be human, both in terms of battling against mortality and the end of the world, but also in the quiet moments of beauty that life is filled with."
208,8,Wildermyth,90,KeenGamer,"Jun 21, 2021","Every aspect of the game is fairly simple. Nothing really drags the game down or carries the game alone, though the character stories are a particular strength. What really makes the game shine is that every aspect of the game complements the others. The developers aimed to create a “myth-making tactical RPG”. I'm not sure I knew what that meant going in, but I do now."
209,8,Wildermyth,90,Gfinity,"Jun 21, 2021","Wildermyth is an exemplary achievement of how to integrate story and gameplay, each enhancing the other and backed by an attractive, storybook art style and stirring soundtrack. I hope to god there are more campaigns coming from the developers in the future because though there’s quite a few in there already, I don’t think I’ll be satiated on Wildermyth for a long time. After all, you never really want the best stories to end."
210,8,Wildermyth,90,PC Gamer,"Jun 15, 2021","I am utterly in love with Wildermyth. With this full release bringing it to five main campaigns and fleshing out endless generic ones, it will satisfy your RPG craving like nothing else."
211,8,Wildermyth,88,Game Informer,"Jul 26, 2021","If you’ve always wanted a fantasy Dungeons & Dragons stylized XCOM game, Wildermyth might be exactly what you’re looking for. Designing a game around randomized storytelling is tricky, but Worldwalker pulls this off with gusto and gravitas."
212,8,Wildermyth,86,The Games Machine,"Jun 29, 2021","Wildermyth is the best turn based strategy game out in the latest months, and also a great RPG. I would have preferred a unique big campaign rather than small stories that aren't even that tied together, but smaller episodes could be more attractive to a casual audience. Artistically beautiful to the eyes, with a very particular style, capable of keeping you glued to the monitor for a long time, although there isn't that much to do when we aren't engaged in turn-based combat. To be played at a high difficulty level, turning the game into an epic chess battle."
213,8,Wildermyth,85,GamingTrend,"Oct 29, 2021","Wildermyth is a fun storytelling game with a ton of possible variance between playthroughs. The stories you make with the game can be very interesting, though it has a tendency to repeat itself a little too frequently."
214,8,Wildermyth,85,GRYOnline.pl,"Sep  9, 2021","Wildermyth is my personal game of the year. Sure, the final grade may not suggest that, but I just know that I'll be returning to this world many times. It's not perfect, but its strength lies in a simple concept, tons of meaning hidden between the lines and a lot of charm that stole my heart. I want more surprises like this."
215,8,Wildermyth,85,COGconnected,"Jul  6, 2021","Overall, Wildermyth is a fantastic addition to the CRPG genre that shows how great procedural generation can be when used smartly. I would highly recommend this game for anyone who is a fan of TTRPGs, maybe even with a couple of friends if your playgroup has been looking for something new to tackle."
216,8,Wildermyth,84,GameStar,"Jul  9, 2021","Passionately produced role-playing game with wonderful character development and fun, but simplistic turn-based battles."
217,8,Wildermyth,80,RPG Site,"Dec 14, 2021","Wildermyth is trying something very few other RPGs do, and it's cool to see how well it all comes together. I find it to be technically impressive and remarkably novel, but unfortunately, the end result is not as interesting as I hoped it would be. Still, with a great aesthetic and a solid enough combat system, it is an earnestly made game unlike much anything else."
218,8,Wildermyth,80,Screen Rant,"Oct 21, 2021","Wildermyth borrows elements from well-known tabletop games, and for all its stumbles, implements them with relative sophistication. It's an ambitious delve into an engaging fantasy world and a player-driven series of stories at its core, creating a customizable framework with almost endless potential. It's worthwhile to dive into for any player looking to find an online alternative to D&D, and thoroughly captivating whether playing alone or with a group."
219,8,Wildermyth,80,Games.cz,"Aug 16, 2021","Wildermyth doesn’t just tell you a single story. Instead, it weaves together many narrative strands to form a procedurally generated adventure for your characters. The tales it tells are superb and underpinned by an excellent combat system."
220,8,Wildermyth,80,Hey Poor Player,"Jul 21, 2021","While I wish it took longer for content to start repeating, Wildermyth proves that a procedurally generated story can still be deeply moving, with memorable characters and relationships. What’s here is already well worth your time, but if the development team keeps working to provide more content, this could become one for the ages."
221,8,Wildermyth,75,RPG Fan,"Jul  6, 2021","Despite my grievances, this is a competent, tightly developed game. I would argue it’s played even a little too safe. Although a genuinely enjoyable experience, I am shocked at the lack of surprises or variety in storytelling and gameplay. This is a perfect example of a game that needs more time in the oven. I can’t imagine the developers will leave this project behind anytime soon, but I certainly hope updates are free and don’t come in the form of paid DLC — at least for a little while. Wildermyth feels unfinished, but the core is sound."
222,8,Wildermyth,70,RPGamer,"Aug  6, 2021","Wildermyth has a lot going for it from its great enemy designs to the calamity structure making each playthrough unique.  As enjoyable as each playthrough is, the unbalanced story structure prevents it from being amazing.  This can be mitigated by gathering some friends and playing through a scenario with them.  The game is a very fun roguelite tactical RPG that introduces some very creative choices, such as the entire Mythic class and transformations.  With simple combat that does not get boring even after many sessions, replayability is very high."
223,9,Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade,100,Screen Rant,"Dec 16, 2021","Square Enix did an amazing job with the port of FF7 Remake on PC. The game runs like a dream and can exceed the console versions in terms of visuals and performance, with a beefy PC. The keyboard controls are functional, but the game was originally designed with a controller in mind, so there's only so much that can be done in this regard. FF7 Remake on PC is the total package in terms of content and performance, and the people who have waited patiently for the game can be assured that the PC version is a high-quality offering, with a more complete version of the story than what was available in the PS4 version at launch."

225,9,Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade,90,PCGamesN,"Jan  2, 2022","A well-judged modern adaptation of one of gaming’s all-time great adventures. The PC port doesn’t push beyond the PS5’s limits though, and who knows how many releases will conclude this remake."

Recommended for both newcomers and fans of the original."
228,9,Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade,90,TheGamer,"Dec 16, 2021","Final Fantasy 7 Remake remains one of the finest JRPGs in recent memory, and its conversion to PC arguably enhances that reputation if you have the right hardware to make it shine. Despite shortcomings in its range of graphical settings and a lack of customisation options, this is a commendable port that runs well, looks even better, and offers patient players on the platform an adventure they’ve been waiting years for. Now it’s finally here, I have a perfect excuse for another playthrough. Bring on the mods, my body is ready."
229,9,Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade,90,Jeuxvideo.com,"Dec 16, 2021","While in substance and form FF7 Remake remains an excellent J-RPG on PC, we can only be disappointed by the “little arms” aspect of this port. The title runs fine on a mid-range machine, but the near absence of graphics settings and incompatibility with ultrawide screens make the toll bitter. So this version does not do much justice to its support and there is more to hope for, perhaps, a life-saving update."

234,9,Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade,83,COGconnected,"Dec 22, 2021","For PC gamers who have not played the console version of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, it’s an easy game to recommend despite the potential technical issues. There is simply too much good. The Remake is one of the best re-imagined games ever made, and the original is demonstrably a masterpiece. We would have liked more options, better optimization, and a lower price tag to be sure, but on PC, Final Fantasy VII Remake looks fantastic and the story, characters, and gameplay deserve every gamer’s time."
235,9,Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade,82,TierraGamer,"Jan 11, 2022","Yes, Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade is still that excellent game that amazed us in its console launch, but we expected far more from the PC version. It's maddening really, that with all the technological advancement it doesn't look better. This is not the port that consumers deserve, but the one that Square Enix could deliver."
236,9,Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade,80,IGN Adria,"Jan 20, 2022","If you have already played Final Fantasy VII Remake on the PlayStation, then we can hardly recommend this port, the only exception being if you are a “PC purist” that also loves a good JRPG along the way. If that is the case, you will finally have the opportunity to try this achievement of a game and see for yourself why fans of the seventh instalment of the long-running JRPG series were so thrilled with this remake a few years ago."
237,9,Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade,80,GamingBolt,"Jan 11, 2022","This version of Final Fantasy 7 Remake isn’t as huge a step up from the PS4 or PS5 version as it should be, but it is still more than a suitable way to experience it outside of the console space."
238,9,Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade,80,GamingTrend,"Jan  3, 2022","An authentic reimagining of the first act as a 30+ hour action-oriented thrill ride with new sub-plots, characters, and an elegant, modern interpretation of the ATB combat system. The remake is still best experienced on consoles, however, where solid performance and controls can be guaranteed."
239,9,Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade,80,PCMag,"Dec 16, 2021","Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is an excellent reimagining of the iconic PS1 JRPG that features fantastic visuals and addicting combat.

240,9,Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade,75,Gamepressure,"Dec 23, 2021","Final Fantasy 7 Remake on PC is the same great game known from consoles, reviving the spirit of the original from 1997... But which, at the same time, suffers from bad decisions of the developers who chose to ignore the specifics of the PC platform, while charging quite a prohibitive sum for it. This simply shouldn't be happening."

But each day plays differently as you learn clues to the visionaries and their daily patterns. And even though the Eternalists inhabit the same locations when you visit at the same time period, the skills and weapons you have acquired and imbued with Residuum allows gamers to play each section in a completely different manner. Whether you want to play a stealthy style game and methodically take out your enemies as you uncover the island’s mysteries, or blast you way through groups of Eternalists, Deathloop allows you to do so. But no matter which style you choose, it is so satisfying once you finally close the loop."

255,10,Deathloop,80,GameWatcher,"Sep 20, 2021","Deathloop turns both succeeding and failing into learning experiences and never makes you miss the lack of a quicksave option. It’s a mean feat that sets it apart from other games, and one of several reasons why it should be on the list of any immersive sim fans out there. It might not be Arkane’s best game and Blackreef may struggle clearly defining a personality for itself, but it’s certainly no stranger to great moments."
256,10,Deathloop,80,Gameblog.fr,"Sep 13, 2021","Deathloop is a unique mix between FPS, sci-fi and mystery in a 70's case. Trapped in a time loop, Colt Vahn must understand and memorize every nook and cranny of a strange island and it's strange cast of vilains. Despite some kind of redundancy in its last hours, Deathloop is an intelligent, beautiful, singular and well-written adventure not to miss."
257,10,Deathloop,80,Jeuxvideo.com,"Sep 13, 2021","Comfortable in the exercise of style imposed by the time loop, the artists of Arkane signed with Deathloop a very good FPS that is as interesting as it is wacky. More action-oriented than a Dishonored, Bethesda's title quickly reaches a level of depth but also of complexity that is rare even for a work by Arkane. The repetitive aspect necessarily linked to the theme of the game is intelligently lessened by the variety of situations, the chance of encounters (with Julianna) and the rise in power. Enjoying a concept of loop without running out of time, Deathloop encourages experiments of all kinds in a universe that contrasts drastically with what the people of Lyon have already produced. And it's good to see that the studio doesn't sing us the same song ... over and over."
258,10,Deathloop,80,Shindig,"Sep 13, 2021","Deathloop is a rewarding and ambitious experience that smartly combines Arkane’s immersive sim bedrock with a fluid nonlinear structure. Its smooth gameplay and naturalistic narrative stylings are interrupted by lacklustre PC performance, though it fulfils a puzzle-box Groundhog Day fantasy few other games have been ambitious enough to touch."
259,10,Deathloop,80,Checkpoint Gaming,"Sep 13, 2021","DEATHLOOP is a cathartic blend of stealth, gunplay and powers that culminate in a satisfying gameplay loop as you explore the eccentric island of Blackreef. Whilst the narrative payoffs don't always live up to the intriguing premise, there's an undeniable sense of style and substance that help carry the game into really favourable territory. Knowledge really is power in DEATHLOOP and there's a pleasurable novelty to much of the game's design that allows it to feel engaging even when the player's hand is held a little too tightly. Even within a year of time loop releases, DEATHLOOP stands out as its own unique beast worth experiencing."
260,10,Deathloop,77,Riot Pixels,"Nov 19, 2021","Too much hand-holding, some glaring omissions in the narrative and its  somewhat weak AI do let Deathloop down, but still, it’s a rare and exciting game made for both fans of Corvo Attano and those who never set foot in the Empire of the Isles before."
261,10,Deathloop,75,MGG,"Sep 13, 2021","Deathloop is a good experience that mixes genres and inspirations against the backdrop of an assassination-based time puzzle. The island and the characters are full of personality, which makes the exploration and discovery of secrets satisfying at first. But you quickly realize that the title doesn't have the means of its ambitions, it's not a very good FPS, nor a good puzzle game, and it doesn't reach the level of Hitman on infiltration and creativity of assassinations. Despite its limitations, you still have a good time on Blackreef Island, and it's fun to progress from loop to loop, getting faster and faster while killing your targets at lightning speed. The multiplayer invasions also add the edge of difficulty and challenge that the rest of the game struggles to offer."
262,10,Deathloop,74,Game World Navigator Magazine,"Oct 22, 2021","It’s hard to recommend Deathloop to anyone. By action standards, the game is plainly boring: it’s basically the same 4 maps over and over again with no variety in enemies or weapons. Cause-and-effect timeloop puzzle gameplay is underwhelming as well: aside from the proper solution, there are very few things to try. [Issue#255, p.56]"
263,10,Deathloop,70,Game Over Online,"Nov  1, 2021","I applaud Arkane for switching up the Dishonored stealth/action formula here, and for addressing a few of the issues Dishonored had. Deathloop just feels too limited by comparison, though, and too repetitive by half besides. I know a lot of people who really like it, but it fell pretty flat for me."
264,10,Deathloop,70,Gamepressure,"Sep 13, 2021","It feels sometimes like Deathloop couldn’t decide what it really wanted to be. Stealth game? Bullet opera? Retro-cool ‘60s spy romp? Mind-melting time travel story? When it tries to be all of these things at once, it ends up not being very much of anything. I liked the core concept but after twenty hours I didn’t feel like I knew more about how an island could get stuck living the same day over and over than I did at the outset."

269,11,Mass Effect Legendary Edition,90,Softpedia,"Jul  6, 2021","Mass Effect Legendary Edition is not just a love letter to fans, but also a great gift that BioWare is making to newcomers to the series. Although some of the issues present in the original games haven't been fixed, there are so many improvements to the first two Mass Effect titles that I'm willing to overlook the minor bugs. The entire trilogy sends players throughout this amazing sci-fi universe that feels alive and vibrant everywhere you look. Perhaps these games should have been remastered separately to get the attention they deserve, but having the entire trilogy in a single bundle that's perfectly playable nearly 15 years after the release of the first game is surely convenient."

BioWare showed us the culmination of everything they learned from their previous games and created a story truly epic in scale…and they actually pulled it off. It devastates me, then, to know these games are from a bygone era. The BioWare which crafted these games simply doesn’t exist anymore. Replaying these three titles continues to hammer that point home. I know I’m cherishing every second I’m spending within Legendary Edition.

This remaster doesn't just give the graphics an update, as is too often the case, or even concentrate the games and almost all of their DLC in a single package, it actively improves the gameplay experience by correcting some of the flaws that plagued the first title in the trilogy, even if it could have gone further at times. Explore the galaxy with Commander Shepard and his crew in an adventure of extraordinary quality that's just as long-lasting.

287,11,Mass Effect Legendary Edition,80,Screen Rant,"May 21, 2021","Mass Effect Legendary Edition is still essentially what a remaster ought to be. It remains faithful to the original, emphasizing everything fans loved or loved to poke fun at while making necessary improvements that make gameplay far more enjoyable on contemporary systems. The inclusion of all three games, the new import system in the unified launcher, and the unified character creation options allows the series to feel like a single, cohesive story experience. Though not without bugs, and though Mass Effect 1 still suffers from its age, Mass Effect Legendary Edition is a great way for veterans to revisit the series and new fans to dive in for the first time - and it seems almost a certainty that Mass Effect Legendary Edition will renew interest in the franchise as work begins on Mass Effect 4."
288,11,Mass Effect Legendary Edition,80,Het Nieuwsblad,"May 17, 2021","The good news first: the games received a graphical update, making them look visually up to date. Oddly enough, this improvement also has a downside: the unique atmosphere that characterized the first part of the series is gone. The dark menace is completely gone, and gloomy surroundings suddenly look like sunny vacation resorts - if you think away the skewered inhabitants. So are we disappointed with this Remastered Edition? Not at all.  The battles remain fantastic: is a sniper hiding behind a wall? Let one of your (computer-controlled) allies throw him into the air and then practice the better clay-pigeon shooting. All this action is embedded in an epic story that can compete with the better Star Trek movie, where the painful choices are made by you."

Embedding with it all the DLC released during the trilogy, some of which are frankly memorable and greatly improving the visuals of the first game, this edition is to date the best way to discover or rediscover the cult saga of Bioware. However, remaster and not remake requires, newcomers and veterans alike will encounter the heaviness of yesteryear on the first episode, with its imprecise cover system, its heavy movements, its loads a little too numerous or its painful inventory."

293,12,Nioh 2: The Complete Edition,100,Gamer Escape,"Feb  9, 2021","Nioh 2 is a refinement of an already great game. The biggest flaw in my opinion of the previous title was that it was difficult to hop into. Truly getting to know a moveset required an investment that wasn’t always easy to recover, and trying to put together a build felt foolish for anything you’d replace down the line. Now it feels a lot more open to experimentation. Everything I loved about the original is still here of course. There’s more stylish moves than ever to learn, and the bosses are more than happy to slam me to the mat any time I start getting overconfident."

Ever since Dark Souls set the world alight, FromSoftware have had plenty of imitators come for the crown. Often, even the better ones come with the caveat of not being as good. Nioh 2, though, evolves what was already unique about Nioh into something that Team Ninja can very much call their own. It might be operating in the same genre space, but Nioh 2 has its own flavour, and it’s like nothing else out there."

It’s equal parts challenging and rewarding, with a loot system that rocks, a combat system that is deep and nuanced, an online component that adds to the experience, and great performance on PC. I haven’t enjoyed myself this much in a long time. If you enjoy games of this subgenre and haven’t yet experienced Nioh 2, the time is now.

But, like a coconut or your really introverted friend, there’s beauty to be found beneath the hard exterior. Team Ninja has made a fantastic addition to the still-young souls-like genre, and I’m incredibly happy that the experience is no longer limited to the PlayStation consoles."

Thankfully, The Complete Edition brings all of the new missions, weapons, magic, and ninjutsu skills that were added post-launch and brings it to PC. This is by far my favorite Souls-like or Soulsborne game and I applaud Team Ninja for pushing Nioh to an elevated status in Nioh 2 and introducing new mechanics, like Burst Counter, instead of letting the combat remain static. Despite the lack of graphical options to choose from, Nioh 2 still ran fantastic and much smoother than on my PS4 Pro. If you are at all interested in a new and challenging Souls-like game, or just love grinding for loot, then Nioh 2 – The Complete Edition is a must-buy on PC."

By adding extra layers of depth to its well-tempered mechanics, it offers a high-quality Action-RPG which retains its unique identity, despite some technical issues. Last but not least, it's a more inviting experience this time around, but as it happens with all Souls-like games, player's commitment is mandatory to progress."

If you haven’t played the original, I hope the review gave you a sense of what the game is like. Are myriad of complexities in action games something that gets you excited or do they sound like needless distractions? I personally lean more to the minimalist side, but when a game pulls off its mechanics as well as Nioh 2, I don’t mind diving in once in head-first."
309,12,Nioh 2: The Complete Edition,85,Worth Playing,"Feb  8, 2021","Nioh 2: The Complete Edition does everything that's expected from a sequel. The original game's mechanics remain as tight as ever, with the new additions slotting in perfectly without upsetting the overall balance. The game remains as tough as ever, but the deaths never feel cheap, and while the depth of the various skill trees and mountains of loot may scare away those who aren't used to this sort of thing, it works perfectly for those who want something different in their masochistic action games. Nioh 2 features a ton of content and the ability to play co-op, so Soulsborne fans will likely be playing this one for a long time."

The presence of all three additional contents published for the title guarantees not only an almost inexhaustible fun, given the new stories and modes, but also a good and interesting closure for a story that will leave a mark on the soulslike scene. A word of warning: make sure your PC is within the hardware requirements."
313,12,Nioh 2: The Complete Edition,80,ZTGD,"Apr 14, 2021","Nioh 2 is not a bad game by any means, I think it is just a style of game that I have grew out of. I’m 35 now, I’m married, have a full-time job, and really don’t have the time to master this game’s many mechanics. That’s not to say it isn’t still overwhelming to me to see all these options here. It most certainly was and for another person, particularly someone who likes this style of game, they will be in heaven. That being said, even I can say this is a must play for people that want a big game with some challenging combat and all the bells and whistles that come with the genre, and this PC version runs and looks just as good as one would expect."
314,12,Nioh 2: The Complete Edition,80,Hey Poor Player,"Feb 19, 2021","Nioh 2 – The Complete Edition is a phenomenal game. And while I would personally recommend getting it on PS4 over PC due to personal circumstances, there really isn’t a whole lot else to say about this game that isn’t some form of praise. If you’re a fan of the original Nioh, or soulslike games in general, this is absolutely something worth picking up. And for those of you who aren’t so accustomed to games like this one? Well, so long as you go in with the right mindset and strive to keep improving yourself, you should end up loving it, too."

317,12,Nioh 2: The Complete Edition,77,Riot Pixels,"Apr  1, 2021","The sequel is mostly an expanded and improved Nioh, with more complex combat mechanics and new challenges for the veterans, yet it's surprisingly accessible to casual players. Yet it fails to correct past mistakes, and you would be hard pressed to see any transformative changes in the game’s formula."
318,12,Nioh 2: The Complete Edition,75,PC Invasion,"Feb  4, 2021","As great as it is frustrating, Nioh 2 will resonate more with people who like the thrill of constantly dying suddenly. The game is brutal, the camera kind of sucks, and a lot of the enemies get old fast. But it's also got extraordinary depth and a bevy of complicated systems that offers players plenty to dig into."
319,12,Nioh 2: The Complete Edition,60,GameGrin,"Mar  4, 2021","An enjoyable game, with an interesting premise which is bogged down and held back by an underwhelming PC port.

There was a period of time when I’d boot Mini Metro every single day in order to undertake the daily challenge. I can see that being the case again here. There’s an intricate, impossible-feeling balance to this game; it is fiendishly difficult and filled with tactical nuance with even things like the angle of how roads join one another impacting traffic speed - and yet it is also joyously mellow and inviting, the perfect way to whittle away some spare minutes. I can barely say a bad word about it."

It’s a meditative simplification of city builders, like if Sim City was a bonsai that only needed the gentlest of tending, and maybe the occasional congestion-busting bypass."
328,13,Mini Motorways,90,KeenGamer,"Jul 20, 2021","Mini Motorways is the ultimate blend of city management and arcade mechanics. Much like running a real city, you don't always know what your options will be in a week, but the population continues on. From the minimal art style and controls to the exciting pace of long runs, there is plenty within this seemingly small offering to enjoy. Suddenly identifying a game-ending traffic jam and heading it off before things get bad is satisfying, and there's always fun to be found in beating your own high score."

I’m pretty sure it lowered my blood pressure, setting a nice calm mood right before bed. Players expecting a sandbox city planning game will be momentarily disappointed, but after only a few minutes with it, that disappointment will melt away (along with the day’s worries and woes). If you need to relax, like, right now, you must check out Mini Motorways."

What immediately caught my attention was its unusual combat system based on summoning spirits that attack your enemies, but I also enjoyed the dark, oneiric and slightly melancholic atmosphere of this beautiful, varied world. Hunting down bosses, discovering shortcuts, and a checkpoint system that resembles Dark Souls’ bonfires give Ender Lilies a distinct soulslike aftertaste. [09/2021, p.64]"

It doesn’t do anything to revolutionize the genre, but it does excel at creating at creating a memorable experience that follows the familiar metroidvania template while still being unique. The visual style and amazing soundtrack complement each other well, creating a sense of tranquility in a desolate and horrific world. The challenge hits that sweet spot where the difficulty is high but victory is never out of reach, learning the enemy behaviors and getting an understanding of the collected abilities will allows players who persist to see the story to its end.

Finesterra introduces one of the most memorable journeys of the year, giving us a decadent universe that is as tragic as beautiful and also with a fun, complex and precise gameplay. Definitely, a must-have not only for those who are fans of the genre, but also for those who are not as well as for anyone that wants to give themselves a true gift. It is an absolute recommendation."

This is a game that knows exactly what it is and what it's setting out to do.

From its speedy combat to its breathtaking visuals, there’s something for any action love fan. The minimal challenge may not mesh well with hardcore players, but exploring this dreary world is rewarding enough. The influences of this adventure only supplement its unique action systems, and very little stands in the way of its beauty."

My time with it was so overwhelmingly positive that I found myself struggling to pinpoint things I didn’t like. To those (like myself) who found themselves enamored with Valkyrie Profile’s theater-of-tragedy style of storytelling, I highly recommend giving Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights a look. To all others, I’d highly recommend it as an incredibly strong action RPG platformer with breathtaking art, engaging gameplay, powerful writing, and an emotive soundtrack that is bound to leave its mark upon you."

It’s a well-made experience, and I had a great time pouring over two dozen hours into this adventure. The presentation rocks, the action is more rewarding than punishing, and its gothic world and lore are alluring. Ender Lilies is a great meat and potatoes experience, demonstrating that simply executing a familiar formula at a high level can be just as welcomed as reinventing the wheel."
354,14,ENDER LILIES: Quietus of the Knights,85,PC Invasion,"Jun 21, 2021","Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights does have a few issues. Overall, though, it more than delivers thanks to vibrant visuals, top-notch Metroidvania platforming, and challenging Souls-like combat."

There isn't much more to say, except that if you enjoyed Hollow Knight or Blasphemous, you are going to have a great time with the baby from Live Wire and Adglobe. Especially since the title has its twist, thanks to its mind system, which will allow you to recover new skills on the bosses beaten. Enough to forge your own style of play, within tortuous and increasingly challenging levels. In short, it's varied, inspired, rich with in addition a good lifespan. A very nice adventure."

The game is a bit of a contradiction – it’s relaxing yet challenging and damaged yet beautiful. Ultimately though, I very much enjoyed roaming the medieval fantasy world of Land’s End and seeing what spirits would join Lily and help her on her quest to cure The Blighted."

It's great to see codemasters actually fixing issues from the last game to this game but only time will tell. Is it worth buying if you already own F1 2020? I don't think so, unless you are a hardcore F1 fan and really want to try Braking Point. For me, the biggest reason to buy it would be for the co-op career, which just seems like too much fun having your friend as a rival or even a team mate and dominating the season. Hopefully this gives way into maybe having a co-op My Team game mode in the future. Seems like a great step forward and I'm glad EA being involved hasn't influenced Codemasters that much."

However, either despite or because of these limitations, this manages a step forward that the series failed to take two years ago, it brings a genuine story to the game. Braking Point is an undeniable success and, one would hope, marks a starting point in which Codemasters can advance as the series moves forward. Beyond this new mode, almost every aspect has been polished to a diamond-like shine, with the only aspects needing improvement are the MyTeam mode, which already looks lacking as a story of progression when compared to Braking Point, and the poor AI in team management. Despite this minor issue, there's no doubt in my mind that this is the best of the franchise so far and a great launching point to the next generation."

While remaining in technical and graphic excellence, the game adds an extra layer of links with real F1 and a bit of emotion with the Breaking Point mode.

There is also a lot to do in all areas (management, development, tuning, driving), depending on the level of complexity that you have adapted to your tastes. A must have for any Formula One fan."

More fun the second time versus that first-run. It’s not perfect, seeing racers celebrate is always weird (they always do the exact same ‘Champagne Robot Dance’) and certain locations have that clinical sim-look that lacks warmth. With a little bit of extra personality and detail found in the seemingly incidental, then the F1 series has potential to be even better.

F1 2021 is only let down by a few frustrating glitches (that will hopefully be ironed out) and an ambitious narrative mode that was too cliche for my taste.

394,16,Guilty Gear -Strive-,90,IGN,"Jun  7, 2021","Guilty Gear Strive is a milestone 2D fighting game that raises the bar for anime-like fighters in terms of its visuals, online netcode, and sheer creativity found in all aspects of its design.

With a gripping plot, enjoyable cast of characters, and steady learning curve the game is set to be one of the series’ most popular entries. I know for myself, I am keen to get stuck into the nitty gritty as I get deeper with the game, and will eventually take my skills online for the real test against actual human players. While I am disappointed the story side of Guilty Gear Strive is relegated to a cinematic story, the plot is rich with drama and stands toe-to-toe with actual anime productions made for TV. Some variety in the battle dialogue and narration wouldn’t have gone astray, either, but in the grand scheme of things is a minor ding against an otherwise brilliant fighter."

Whether you’re trapped in the series’ staple claustrophobic tunnels or staring out across an expansive vista in the new open-world sections, Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition looks absolutely stunning thanks to its significant graphical overhaul."

459,19,Death's Door,90,Atomix,"Nov 12, 2021","Despite not doing much in terms of innovation, coupled with a pair of odd framerate issues, Death's Door is a fantastic indie game that seems to do almost everything right. A precise combat, gorgeous environments and a mysterious yet beautiful world, make this an experience you simply can't miss."
460,19,Death's Door,90,TrueGaming,"Jul 28, 2021","Death's Door finds the sweet spot between an enjoyable and challenging experience. The smooth and fun combat was supplemented with fun puzzles and many secrets, all packaged in an adorable cartoonish art style."
461,19,Death's Door,90,GameStar,"Jul 28, 2021",Death’s Door is an exceptional action-RPG that delights with challenging combat and cleverly thought-out game design.
462,19,Death's Door,90,Destructoid,"Jul 28, 2021","An exercise in design excellence, Death’s Door recognizes and capitalizes on its strengths to deliver a smart, creative, and thoroughly engaging adventure, painted with wonderful visual strokes and peppered with witty, thoughtful commentary on life, death, and how we spend the hours in-between. Sporting polish beyond its budget and ambition beyond its scale, Death’s Door is one of the year’s best releases, and a must-play for adventure fans everywhere. Don’t fear the Reaper."
463,19,Death's Door,90,Hooked Gamers,"Jul 22, 2021","I honestly had a blast with Death's Door, with the only major problem I ran into being some save file problems. Admittedly, playing a pre-release version of the game could have had something to do with that. The game is not phenomenally long, sitting at around twelve or so hours, with the chance of it being even less if you have fewer issues with the somewhat unforgiving nature of the game. There’s also no difficulty scaler which may turn off some players who want a slightly less difficult playthrough. If you too like to roll on the darker side of life, or death if you will, give this game a chance!"
464,19,Death's Door,90,Malditos Nerds,"Jul 22, 2021","Death's Door is amazing in many ways, but more than anything for anyone looking for a great single player experience with hours and hours of gameplay and many secrets to discover."
465,19,Death's Door,90,Hardcore Gamer,"Jul 21, 2021","Death’s Door is a gem of a soulslike game with a nice and meaty level of challenge and a world filled with lovable characters and loads of secrets to uncover. It may seem minor compared to most in the genre when it comes to length, clocking in at around ten to twelve hours, but it will be one memorable journey. Come for the charming little crow and the colorful cast that they meet after slicing and dicing a few dozen monsters, stay for the excellent writing and the superb tale about death. It’s all to die for."
466,19,Death's Door,90,Digital Chumps,"Jul 21, 2021","Death’s Door‘s brisk and satisfying story pace allows players to soak up the adventure with efficiency and delight, never dragging on because of complicated puzzles and strenuous combat. Ultimately, though, I never wanted Death’s Door to end because this is an immensely satisfying, lovingly constructed world Acid Nerve has made. Both a fairy tale and an epic journey, it’s packed with wonder and whimsy. Anyone who has a love for gaming will recognize something they adore in Death’s Door. This universe is too good to resist and it is my sincere hope that this first taste won’t be the last."
467,19,Death's Door,90,Digital Trends,"Jul 20, 2021",Death’s Door is one of the best games released this year and will certainly be a game-of-the-year contender by the time 2021 wraps up.
468,19,Death's Door,90,GamingTrend,"Jul 20, 2021","Buy it. Play it. Enjoy it. It’s as simple as the game feels, even if it challenges you more than you’d ever think it would. The more I’ve played it, the more I see every one of it’s accomplishments, with fantastic gameplay and a great choice of art style and soundtrack jewels in its crown. Death’s Door does nearly everything right for what it is, and even the shortcomings of the narrative is barely a blemish on a spectacular résumé."
469,19,Death's Door,90,Shacknews,"Jul 20, 2021","Death’s Door combines excellent story and lore with challenging and rewarding combat. As an action game, there’s a lot to love about the enemies faced and customization available. Story can easily take the backseat in a game like this, but the sheer concept of it all and the lore dumped on top makes the story in Death’s Door equally intriguing. Acid Nerve delivers one of the more well-rounded titles I’ve played this year with Death’s Door."
470,19,Death's Door,90,IGN,"Jul 20, 2021","Death’s Door is a must for those looking to scratch the itch of a classic Zelda dungeon-delving game, with the added bonus of impeccable combat against waves of foes in a creepy world. Secrets are plentiful enough to offset the low variety of rewards, and the cohesion of puzzle-solving and combat encounters worked terrifically to challenge me in all the right ways. While I wish the adventure didn’t end so soon, as a reaper of souls I should know: nothing lasts forever."
471,19,Death's Door,90,WellPlayed,"Jul 20, 2021","Death's Door feels great to play, it's beautiful to look at, and the characters and world are beyond memorable – clock in and get your reap on."
472,19,Death's Door,90,Checkpoint Gaming,"Jul 20, 2021","Death’s Door crashes onto the scene stylistically with an amazingly detailed, interconnected world full to the brim with personality and secrets. The game introduces great characters that bring with them charisma and humanity as it lovingly juggles both the morbid and the beautiful sides of its narrative. With simply phenomenal sound design that lovingly accompanies and amplifies the visuals and atmosphere, Death’s Door presents one door absolutely worth knocking on."
473,19,Death's Door,90,Digitally Downloaded,"Jul 20, 2021","Death’s Door is a tremendously well-designed game, with superb production values and a tight core gameplay loop. I was immersed and impressed the whole way through, ready to rise to any challenge the game would throw at me, because I was so in love with its design and its world. You don’t have to be a fan of Zelda-style games to see the appeal of this one: Death’s Door is simply the tried and true fundamentals of game design, refined and polished to the ultimate degree."
474,19,Death's Door,90,Twinfinite,"Jul 20, 2021","Even with its grueling final boss fight, I absolutely adored every second of Death’s Door. The world developer Acid Nerve has created still feels rife with secrets I’m still yet to uncover after 10 hours with the game. Outside of a minor technical blip and a significant difficulty spike towards the end, Death’s Door is simply sensational. It may not have that AAA budget or cutting-edge super realistic graphics, but it’s jam-packed with charm, style, and challenging, rewarding action that it’s an absolute must-play this year."
475,19,Death's Door,90,Screen Rant,"Jul 20, 2021","Death's Door is a beautiful, refined, and digestible action-adventure with particularly stunning visual and audio design."
476,19,Death's Door,90,Gamers Heroes,"Jul 20, 2021","For the most part, Death's Door hits it out of the park and is easily a contender for indie GOTY. Fans of top-down action RPGs shouldn't hesitate to pick this one up."
477,19,Death's Door,88,LevelUp,"Jul 28, 2021","Death’s Door is a game that delivers on all counts: responsive control, interesting mechanics, satisfying story, replayability, and well-designed difficulty. Hard to think of not recommending it to anyone who plays video games. Death’s Door once again shows us that an indie title can be a great game and compete for the best of the year without spending millions of dollars. Direct to the best of the year."
478,19,Death's Door,88,The Games Machine,"Jul 23, 2021","One of the most surprising games of the year, Death's Door delivers a frantic and greatly enjoyable action-adventure experience with an ipnotic noir mood."
479,19,Death's Door,86,Gamersky,"Dec 20, 2021","Death's Door builds a world that fully engages players in exploration, and it looks somewhat like an excellent fusion of The Legend of Zelda and Dark Souls series. Although the ability design of this game is somewhat lacking in new ideas and the volume of levels is slightly insufficient, it is an excellent work that cannot be missed for any fan of independent games."
480,19,Death's Door,85,RPG Fan,"Oct  5, 2021","Overall, Death’s Door is an enjoyable homage to 2D Zelda games with some additional quirky flair thrown in. It is a satisfying experience whose main drawback is its overall safeness, plus a lack of replayability. Some may also be turned off by the lack of extreme difficulty, which can be another source of replay value for many similar games. I would recommend Death’s Door to those looking for a nostalgia fix that won’t try your patience or just want to enjoy a memorable and contemplative audiovisual style."
481,19,Death's Door,85,IGN Italia,"Jul 21, 2021","An Action-RPG full of passion that focuses on simplicity and, for this reason, it is incredibly solid. Level design, attention to detail, art style and soundtrack deserve just applause. Ok, it throws you in an huge labirint without any map, but it can be even a good thing."
482,19,Death's Door,85,PC Invasion,"Jul 21, 2021",This tremendously excellent Death's Door is a well-polished action/adventure hybrid that is worth your attention.
483,19,Death's Door,85,Softpedia,"Jul 20, 2021","Death’s Door has good core mechanics but does not introduce the one big innovation that could make it stand out. I enjoy the battles, especially the bigger ones, but I feel that the puzzles are average, as is the exploration. Some players might draw comparisons to Hades but this is a very different experience that does not aim for the same narrative depth. It’s linear, there are no rogue elements, and the variety in encounters is more limited."
484,19,Death's Door,85,Easy Allies,"Jul 20, 2021","Death's Door is a solid title that gives a great sense of discovery, while also providing some challenging highlights that never feel unfair. A few more bosses would be appreciated, and some of its characters could use some more love, but the fluid combat and simple but enjoyable puzzles make it a pleasure to play. It's an easy recommendation to anyone looking for a lighthearted, quirky adventure."
485,19,Death's Door,85,Noisy Pixel,"Jul 20, 2021","Death’s Door breathes some life into the generalized umbrella of action-adventure titles thanks to its efficient level design coupled with simple to grasp yet enjoyable mechanics. While a few factors, such as the ranged skill usage bar, are questionable in execution, the game’s flow and pace are never significantly hindered from ruining the experience as a whole. Furthermore, the dreary thematic tones exuded by the loneliness of the varied explorable sections alongside the appealing characterizations and dialogue also serve to make Death’s Door an assuredly exceptional time for those feeling even remotely curious."
486,19,Death's Door,83,PC Gamer,"Jul 20, 2021","Death's Door boils modern action-adventure game design down to its fundamentals, and the reduction is excellent."
487,19,Death's Door,82,Worth Playing,"Jul 20, 2021","Overall, Death's Door is a success. It's a short but entertaining and combat-heavy Zelda-like action-adventure that is only limited by scope. It might not have the most memorable puzzles or dungeons, but it has enough heart and skill to make up for its few, minor missteps."
488,19,Death's Door,80,Games.cz,"Aug 16, 2021","If you don’t own a Nintendo Switch, this is one of the best takes on the classic Zelda formula, a combination of fun combat, beautiful graphics and many, many secrets. Prepare to be charmed!"
489,19,Death's Door,80,Edge Magazine,"Aug 14, 2021","A distinctive twist on an established formula, and a remarkable accomplishment for such a small team. Its subject matter might seem like serious business, but this game about death feels thrillingly alive. [Issue#362, p.112]"
490,19,Death's Door,80,GameOver.gr,"Jul 30, 2021","The beautiful aesthetic of Death’s Door is elevated by the amazing soundtrack establishing a world that is a pure joy to explore. A well-rounded isometric adventure with combat that is fast without being overly punishing, consistently clever level design, and story that presents an enjoyable dark fairy tale with nice humorous touches."
491,19,Death's Door,80,Jeuxvideo.com,"Jul 28, 2021","With Death's Door, Acid Nerve hits the mark once again. The British studio unveils here a magnificent epic which, admittedly, may lack originality in substance, but charms in its form. In addition to enjoying spectacular clashes, the action / adventure game takes you on a journey by revealing an inspired universe. All in nuances, the world of Death's Door is constantly highlighted by its varied artistic direction, its rhythmic sound-design and its characters torn between life and death. Sold at a low price, the title published by Devolver Digital is in our opinion the breath of fresh air not to be missed this summer."
492,19,Death's Door,80,MGG Spain,"Jul 28, 2021","The general feeling with Death Door is being in front of a good game, which ends up getting lost a little when trying to do a little more than what the design intuits during the first hours. That does not detract from the fact that it is a tremendously enjoyable title and very careful in multiple aspects. A solid game that also has a perfect duration for what it proposes."
493,19,Death's Door,80,Gamer.nl,"Jul 28, 2021","Death's Door is a great Zelda-inspired game that relies on exciting (boss) fights and an excellently set up world. The game never really manages to rise above its great example, but is so solid and equipped with such a good soundtrack that this is never a serious problem. Death's Door even has enough surprises in store to keep it fun after the end."
494,19,Death's Door,80,Gfinity,"Jul 27, 2021","Death’s Door is definitely good. The problems it has are not dealbreakers and the places it excels - namely gameplay and atmosphere - more than suffice for a robust experience. Sure, it is short, but it’s also no longer than it needs to be, a lesson that a lot of games still need to learn. Enjoy it across a weekend or a week at most, and try not to burst a blood vessel on some of the later bosses."
495,19,Death's Door,80,Gameblog.fr,"Jul 23, 2021","Death's Door is a nervous action game that transcends Acid Nerve's old formula. Thanks to a clever difficulty, fights with brand new situations, a rewarding exploration and a beautiful soundtrack, Death's Door is the perfect well-balanced experience of this summer, despite a very light pathfinding."
496,19,Death's Door,80,IGN Spain,"Jul 21, 2021","Death's Door is one of the indie surprises of the year. Very well designed, melancholic and challenging, without being difficult. It knows how to transfer the essence of games like Dark Souls and Zelda in a delicious isometric perspective, with well-designed puzzles and a very well measured combat. Acid Nerve has done its homework."
497,19,Death's Door,80,NME,"Jul 21, 2021","Death’s Door welcomes the player to its consistently entertaining world of unique, stubborn bosses and intriguing exploration with surprising accessibility, humor and elegant design. Once you pick it up, you’ll find yourself eager to conquer the game’s balanced challenges. There are frustrations here, but they’re few and far between."
498,19,Death's Door,80,Gamer.no,"Jul 20, 2021","Death's Door is a wonderful action RPG, and a great option for fans of challenging games who are looking for something a little more accessible."
499,19,Death's Door,80,Eurogamer Italy,"Jul 20, 2021",Death's Door is a wonderful action adventure inspired by Zelda and rich with secrets and stories to unfold. Despite the on the surface simplistic combat system this is a great game both in combat and in exploration even if the latter is definitely the grand protagonist. [Eurogamer.it Recommended]
500,19,Death's Door,80,PC Games,"Jul 20, 2021","Sometimes Death’s Door is pretty crisp, especially a passage in the Ceramic Palace really made me curse. But I couldn't stop, I wanted to move on. The game did a really good job of keeping me going despite all the setbacks. One flaw: even before the test, I played a preview version of Death's Door, which ran very smoothly. That's why I'm pretty amazed that performance drops occur in the full version. For me the adventure is still an indie highlight and I wait patiently for patches so that Death's Door runs as smoothly as before."
501,19,Death's Door,80,Multiplayer.it,"Jul 20, 2021","Death's Door is a game where the journey counts more than the destination: a fine experience overall, despite some minor flaws here and there."
502,19,Death's Door,80,GameSpot,"Jul 20, 2021","With an engaging world to explore and consistently satisfying combat to keep things entertaining, it's easy to fall in love with Death's Door. Its premise hooks you immediately, and it has the style and the substance to maintain the captivating allure of its opening. Perhaps most importantly, it's just consistently fun to play, with sharp enemy designs that keep you on your feet to challenging boss fights that test your skills in satisfying ways. There's a lot of death to deal and souls to reap, but Death's Door makes it a delight every step of the way."
503,19,Death's Door,80,Attack of the Fanboy,"Jul 20, 2021","All in all, Acid Nerve did a great job with Death’s Door and by pushing just a little bit more while taking a few calculated risks, they would have an outstanding game rather than a very good one. Still more than worth playing if you’re a fan of the genre and aren’t looking for something revolutionary. There is also some post-game content that should add some additional run time to your enjoyment."
504,19,Death's Door,78,Vandal,"Jul 20, 2021","Death’s Door is a charming, enjoyable adventure we had a great time with, but it also fails to break through, becoming repetitive and lacking that something special that would have taken it much higher."
505,19,Death's Door,76,New Game Network,"Jul 26, 2021","Death's Door is a streamlined action adventure experience that finds a groove and sticks with it. With a low asking price and high level of polish, fans of this genre should find the little crow's soul reaping journey quite endearing."
506,19,Death's Door,75,GameCritics,"Aug 13, 2021","Death’s Door is a strong offering featuring challenging combat and amazing art design. The amount of love and care Acid Nerve put into this quirky afterlife can easily be seen in every little animation or dialogue. Granted, the combat may be a bit overwhelming at times (especially when the puzzles become infrequent) but for lovers of the genre and those who won’t mind a bit of swordfighting and dodging, Death’s Door might be one of the best titles to come out in 2021."
507,19,Death's Door,72,TierraGamer,"Sep  2, 2021","Its high difficulty (sometimes artificially) and its art direction make it a must-try video game. However, it can be frustrating due to the lack of maps, unnecessary difficulty peaks and some bugs that make the experience worse."
508,19,Death's Door,70,CD-Action,"Oct 12, 2021","The protagonist doesn’t have a believable motivation, while the enemies, the environments and the gameplay mechanics lack variety. Other than that Death’s Door is a really decent action RPG – it’s pretty, technically polished, rich in optional content, and welcoming of inexperienced players. [10/2021, p.68]"
509,19,Death's Door,70,Riot Pixels,"Aug 15, 2021","This fairytale is somewhat simplistic in its story and structure, but still charming."
510,19,Death's Door,68,Game World Navigator Magazine,"Sep  3, 2021","The setting is intriguing, but the story is bland. Open world promises exploration, but there is nothing to find. The combat has all the beats – but it just isn’t interesting. [Issue#254, p.68]"
511,20,Inscryption,100,Games.cz,"Jan 13, 2022","This game is utterly bizarre. Gripping. Breath-taking. Surprising. Innovative. Turbulent. You simply must experience it yourself, from start to finish, to truly understand how amazing it is. One of the best games of the year."
512,20,Inscryption,100,ZTGD,"Nov 30, 2021","All I can really say is that I think the narrative is extremely well done and I should have expected that coming from the guy who also created Pony Island which I thoroughly enjoyed as well. The art design and the audio design are also top notch. Expect to see this on plenty of GOTY lists as well as GOTY discussions because what I think Inscryption is extremely well done both in narrative and gameplay. I have a hope that maybe someday we see a multiplayer spin off because there’s still a lot this IP can offer, and I have friends who have played this as well and loved it and I really would like to challenge their decks. It could have survived on simply being a great card game and it managed to exceed that simple expectation and left me wanting more."
513,20,Inscryption,100,IGN Japan,"Nov 16, 2021","Incsryption is a deck-building roguelike game with a great metafiction scenario. Even the deck-building and roguelike elements are just part of what this game makes you think it is, as the game’s structure keeps changing as you progress. This continuous change of style makes you feel like you're playing a very special game, and it will keep you excited throughout the experience."
514,20,Inscryption,100,Player 2,"Nov  9, 2021","Inscryption is full of charm, humour, and a healthy dose of mystery. Forget what you think you know about this game, it’s so much more."
515,20,Inscryption,100,Gaming Nexus,"Oct 18, 2021","Go into Inscryption as unspoiled as possible, and trust in the game. You will find a deeply enjoyable card game, wrapped in a series of dark mysteries, wrapped in…well…other stuff. Part CCG game, part escape room puzzle game, and part bonkers gonzo whirlybird lunacy, Inscryption is one of the best games of the year. They should charge more for a game this good."
516,20,Inscryption,95,Hooked Gamers,"Nov  1, 2021","When I was first assigned this game for review, I thought that it might be just another card drawing and puzzle affair that seem to be common these days. However, Inscryption kept my attention until the very end. The plot, the dark theme, and the mysterious mechanics is so well thought out that I have to give it an enthusiastic two thumbs up. The only downside that I can think of is that replayability might be limited after the first couple of play throughs. Even with that said, this title is worth the price of admission."
517,20,Inscryption,95,MGG Spain,"Oct 18, 2021","Inscryption is a game that seeks to advance the medium, challenge the player and make him participate in something huge. This would be enough to consider it a great title, but on top of that it is brilliantly designed and the characters and story will not be easily forgotten"
518,20,Inscryption,90,Game Informer,"Nov 22, 2021","Inscryption is an oddity of the best order. It's a horror game that isn't aggressively trying to scare you. It's also a clever card system wrapped around a compelling mystery that plays with video game conventions. Like a bat out of hell, Inscryption came out of nowhere and quickly became one of my favorite games of the year."
519,20,Inscryption,90,PC Games,"Nov 19, 2021","Inscryption is a masterpiece. It combines rogue-like elements with card-based gameplay and brings with it with one of the best stories we’ve experienced in a long time. The only real criticism we have is the relatively short time it took us to beat the game. Nonetheless, Inscryption is one of the best games of the year, indie or otherwise."
520,20,Inscryption,90,Everyeye.it,"Nov 16, 2021","Inscryption is a damn fun card game: a roguelite, a puzzle game and a story with horror tinges, and all of this is barely enough to describe what on balance are only the first hours of the experience. It is the consecration of Daniel Mullins and his idea of the code as a sentient and malignant entity that turns against the user, upsetting his role and his relationship with the game. A card game with a punk soul, developed by a developer with a punk soul and distributed by punks who have made subversive indie their trademark. An absolute triumph."
521,20,Inscryption,90,Malditos Nerds,"Nov  9, 2021","Inscryption, without a doubt, is one of the best indie games of 2021. In the indie scene, there are quite a few risky and unique projects, but few are also as fun in the most playful sense as Inscryption."
522,20,Inscryption,90,Meristation,"Oct 30, 2021","Inscryption is much more than a card game with a roguelike base and puzzle touches in an escape room setting. Without a doubt, it is one of the great surprises of this year 2021."
523,20,Inscryption,90,IGN,"Oct 28, 2021","Inscryption is as consistently fun as it is surprising, with a wonderfully creepy story cleverly tying its ever-evolving mechanics together."
524,20,Inscryption,90,Softpedia,"Oct 20, 2021","Inscryption is another great experience from Daniel Mullins and his studio. Their take on the already very crowded card game and rogue combination is a unique but recognizable one. I liked the combat, the level of complexity, the challenge posed by the bosses. And I loved the way it integrates with the wider world of the game and the story it tells. I would like to see more use for the sacrifice mechanic and some extra ways to cheat the rules. But self-aware creatures, cards that immortalize failed runs, and general creepiness add a lot to the core concepts. Inscryption has all the necessary ingredients to set a new standard of quality for its genre and keep fans engaged for tens of hours."
525,20,Inscryption,90,Gamer Escape,"Oct 19, 2021","Inscryption is an amazingly well-put-together piece of work. The atmosphere presented…well, I’ve already doted on it multiple times. And I’ll do so again: it’s unsettling, occasionally oppressive, and always keeps the player on their toes. It could easily carry the work on its own, but luckily the card game mechanics are solid and sound as well. It’s easy to pick up, but with a ton of variables to allow customization and multiple viable approaches to the challenges provided. If only it didn’t stumble literally right at the finish line, I’d call this a near-perfectly designed game. Unfortunately, that last moment soured me on the experience…not enough render the whole thing moot (a la Mass Effect 3), but I just can’t shake it off. Despite that, Inscryption is a game that I can recommend highly. Even if you’re not typically a fan of deckbuilding games (just as I used to be), if you want some unsettling vibes for the season, this is your game right here."
526,20,Inscryption,90,WellPlayed,"Oct 18, 2021","Far more than a card game, Inscryption is a dark odyssey into an even darker narrative – commanding your attention in an exciting, gripping manner."
527,20,Inscryption,90,Checkpoint Gaming,"Oct 18, 2021","On the surface, Inscryption is described as a card game, but it hides a lot more than just cards under the bonnet. Prepare for a layered story, thrilling surprises, and terrifying yet fascinating characters that will keep you glued to your seat. The game masterfully expands on the story playthrough after playthrough, providing a fresh perspective with each run. In this sense, Inscryption is a great twist on the otherwise repetitive roguelike formula that has dominated the deckbuilder genre in the last few years. This, in addition to the strange storytelling we’ve come to expect from Daniel Mullins, makes for a gaming experience that is not to be missed for card game and narrative game fans alike."
528,20,Inscryption,90,Hardcore Gamer,"Oct 18, 2021","Inscryption manages to combine an expertly-crafted card game, a nail-biting tale of horror and enjoyable escape room adventures into another genre-defying gem and easily one of the year’s best games. Whether you come for the gameplay and strategy, the story and atmosphere, or both, you’ll walk away awestruck at the sheer, brilliant madness you just experienced. Daniel Mullins does it again, and once again, we urge readers not to read the reviews or other coverage as much as possible and just go in blind, experiencing this twisted odyssey for yourself. You’ll be glad you did."
529,20,Inscryption,90,COGconnected,"Oct 18, 2021","All in all, Inscryption is a great–and spooky–game that is constantly expanding and re-inventing itself, and I recommend it to anyone who loves horror. As long as you approach it with an open mind, a strong stomach, and the willingness to keep trying, you should have a great time with this title. Just remember: if you think the game is over in the first few hours, it’s time to hit the New Game button and see what you’ve unlocked."
530,20,Inscryption,90,Noisy Pixel,"Oct 18, 2021","With its dreary visuals and unsettling soundtrack, Inscryption offers a unique deck-building experience with added immersive puzzles. It creates an incredible atmosphere for a game with such a simplistic and dark design. Still, it delivers it in a memorable way, accessible to anyone who dare set out on the journey. In a world where roguelikes are daunting for some, this is one nightmare that I didn’t mind diving back into."
531,20,Inscryption,90,Multiplayer.it,"Oct 18, 2021","Fresh, intense and challenging without being complex; that's how we would define Inscryption. Mullins' adventure, published by Devolver Digital, is a card game but also an escape room. The card battles are fast, fun and extremely varied and in the background there is also an interesting, exciting, well-acted plot."
532,20,Inscryption,90,Hey Poor Player,"Oct 18, 2021","Inscryption is refreshingly unique. With all the roguelike deckbuilders popping up these days, they can all start to blend together. Inscryption manages to stand out from the crowd in all the best ways. Complex card strategies blend with escape room puzzles far better than should be possible. And the whole package is wrapped in such perfectly, wonderfully creepy trappings that it’s perfect for the Halloween season. Just remember: don’t ever assume you’ve reached the end."

534,20,Inscryption,86,Gamersky,"Dec  2, 2021","Inscryption uses the appearance of Roguelike cards to ""cheat"" players in, and then uses the depth and fun of card battles to firmly hold on to players. When players are immersed in it, the game then presents a completely different look with a subversive ""new game"" - such an experience is indeed hard to replicate and impressive."
535,20,Inscryption,86,GameWatcher,"Nov 10, 2021","Despite minimal flaws, Inscryption masters the experiment of blending a
card game and horror into a bizarre mindtrip."
536,20,Inscryption,85,Jeuxvideo.com,"Dec 19, 2021","Inscryption is much, much more than a deck building game. Rogue lite, escape game, horror, adventure ... the title of Daniel Mullins Games is a game of everything, which succeeds almost everything it does. By never giving the player time to be bored, offering a well thought out narration and never hesitating to surprise the player who thought they had covered the matter, Inscryption is a small UFO in the video game. If the second part of the game turns out to be a little disappointing and the random dimension may frustrate people less used to the genre, it's hard not to warmly recommend this experience as strange as it is surprising."
537,20,Inscryption,85,MGG,"Oct 31, 2021","If Inscryption can repel some with its pixelated graphics and its purely textual dialogues, it fully assumes its old school side. And it is right to do so since its artistic direction is clearly convincing. As for the gameplay, it is full of creativity and offers us an adventure where the rules are constantly reinvented to surprise us each time in a particularly efficient way. Another little indie gem."

539,20,Inscryption,82,TierraGamer,"Nov  6, 2021","Inscryption combines roguelike mechanics with an oppressive and gloomy atmosphere that will terrorize you. Its strongest asset is in its narrative and artistic direction, although it falters when it comes to graphics."
540,20,Inscryption,80,GameOver.gr,"Nov 19, 2021","Even if you feel extremely tired from the oversaturation of card-based games you should give Inscryption a change. Its fresh take on the genre offers an especially clever satire of the card-based motif and an overall experience that in the end feels like a well-crafted story-based game disguised as a roguelike. Its full story comes to an end at around 8 hours, but not before it provides a wealth of unexpected twists and turns in both its gameplay and presentation."
541,20,Inscryption,80,GameSpot,"Nov 15, 2021","The first act is just brilliant. Not only is the core card game at its best, but it's also where those mechanics are best served by the richly atmospheric trappings surrounding them. The following two acts admirably offer new twists on the mechanics and a different perspective on the narrative, but neither prove as satisfying as the original. Alone, Act 1 is one of the best games of the year, but everything that comes after drags it back into the pack."
542,20,Inscryption,80,Gamer.nl,"Oct 27, 2021","Developer Daniel Mullens returns with another strange meta-game about card games, games in general and player expectations. Astonishingly he once more succeeds in completely surprising us, which at this point isn't much of a surprise."

544,20,Inscryption,80,Screen Rant,"Oct 18, 2021","Inscryption’s arrival in mid-October makes for a perfect Halloween game. What seems most vital for the game's success will be to casually get it to people who won’t know what to expect, like fans of deckbuilders just looking for another to add to their pile. Still, even if players go into Inscryption expecting the unexpected, there’s entertaining depth to its mechanics and narrative, a form of storytelling that could only exist in a video game."

548,20,Inscryption,80,Slant Magazine,"Oct 18, 2021",The game is an unholy hybrid of a roguelike deck-builder and first-person escape-room experience that reveals itself to be a grand reflection of and meditation on lives lived within a bubble.
549,20,Inscryption,77,Riot Pixels,"Nov 19, 2021","Inscryption does a lot of things right. At the same time, the abundance of superfluous elements upsets the internal harmony of this game."
550,20,Inscryption,75,GameCritics,"Oct 28, 2021","Overall, Inscryption probably feels more like a traditional videogame than his previous works, but it’s a more difficult experience, with much relying on one’s luck and the RNG. While I believe deckbuilder fans could be interested, this is likely of more interest to connoisseurs of weird or strange narratives. I’ll leave it at that since saying more would likely spoil the trick, and like any good magician, I’m guessing that Mullins is loath to have his secrets revealed so easily."
551,20,Inscryption,75,Destructoid,"Oct 18, 2021","I was deeply absorbed until the game flipped for the first time, then I fell out of love. I reconciled before the end, but I was still left feeling like I played a few similar games of different quality.

560,21,The Forgotten City,100,Hey Poor Player,"Jul 31, 2021","It’s easy to point out what The Forgotten City does right — mechanics, progression, story, gameplay, dialog, quests, atmosphere, design, voice acting, etc. — but hard to say what it does best, because it’s all supremely well done. With a wildly imaginative concept executed perfectly and poignantly, The Forgotten City will please anyone with an interest in history, philosophy, mythology, or just a good, tight exploration story. The Forgotten City is my top contender for GOTY 2021 — a distinction I don’t foresee being toppled. This city without sin may not have any exits, but that’s just as well, since you won’t want to leave anyway."

565,21,The Forgotten City,90,Game Informer,"Aug  1, 2021","Regardless of the visual shortcomings, The Forgotten City stands tall as a unique game that pulls you in with its world and words. I got a huge kick using time travel as a detective tool and found many of the characters to be delightful to chat with (even if they hold many dark secrets). If you are in the market for a different type of game that pushes you to stitch together a story in different ways than you would expect, don’t sleep on this inventive experience. It’s one that you won’t soon forget."
566,21,The Forgotten City,90,The Indie Game Website,"Jul 29, 2021","It must be pretty obvious by now that I love this game. I love the effort that went into it and the expansive scope of its contents. I love how easy the gameplay is to grasp and how complex its plot becomes. I love the surprises and mysteries, and how each character is so full of soul. History buffs will have hours of spotting little details and accuracies, and fans of a good old-fashioned mystery will be kept up all night by the perplexing curse that has befallen this town."

573,21,The Forgotten City,80,Games.cz,"Nov 30, 2021",A brilliant game that’s all about conversations. You get stuck in a time loop which sounds potentially frustrating but actually isn’t because you don’t have to repeat yourself in any way. It’s just a shame that the game’s a bit ugly and the puzzles a bit trivial.
574,21,The Forgotten City,80,CD-Action,"Oct 12, 2021","It’s a very good game, but it was tailored for a specific audience. If you put the story above everything else, you’ll have a great time playing The Forgotten City. However, if you’d like to feel the adrenaline rush at least once in a while, it’s probably not a game for you, because there’s barely any action here. Oh, don’t be afraid of the whole time loop thing – this integral mechanic is forgiving and won’t erase your progress without a serious reason. If it resets, it’ll be a consequence of either wrong choices or a conscious decision. [10/2021, p.32]"

There’s care and an attention to detail worth celebrating here. Roman culture isn’t simply a cool historical backdrop, customs, behaviours, what we now know of the times can be found and felt in every corner of the world. And in many of the conversations you’ll have."
578,21,The Forgotten City,80,Jeuxvideo.com,"Aug  2, 2021","With top-notch writing and screenplay, The Forgotten City manages with disconcerting ease to embark the player in a gripping, supernatural and historical tale. A success that is not necessarily obvious from the first moments, when the technical shortcomings of the title (some display problems, animations not always at the top) and the very many dialogues may be put off. But this first impression quickly fades when entering straight into the cursed city of the Modern Storyteller studio, where the famous golden rule is likely to result in the death of all its inhabitants if one of them between them commits the least sin. This initial idea thus gives birth to a whole lot of reflection, on the human condition as well as on the culture of each one, and will bring the player to face many reversals of situation, all well brought up. A very pleasant surprise for fans of the investigation / adventure game."
579,21,The Forgotten City,80,Eurogamer Italy,"Jul 27, 2021","The Forgotten City abandons its mod form, grows and adds content to become a standalone game. The atmosphere of a Roman city trapped in a time loop returns to envelop us with new mysteries and enigmas scattered on the road to truth."
580,21,The Forgotten City,80,Twinfinite,"Jul 27, 2021","I still highly recommend that anyone who loved the original mod that inspired The Forgotten City or anyone that just likes a good story-driven title play this game. The time loop mechanic, evolving dialogue, and myriad of choices and scenarios that occur make for one hell of a narrative ride, just keep your expectations of the combat low, or else you may be disappointed."
581,21,The Forgotten City,80,Stevivor,"Jul 27, 2021","The Forgotten City expands upon the original concept of a small mod and has been developed into a rich and well-balanced experience. While its gameplay is simple, its narrative and atmosphere shine through. A great game from start to end, The Forgotten City is a perfect gem for gamers who love a mystery. More than that though, it’s a fantastic game that explores the complexity of morality and challenges players to do the same long after its completion."
582,21,The Forgotten City,80,MGG,"Jul 27, 2021","If The Forgotten City is based on a mod initially designed for Skyrim, it knows how to detach itself from it to become a work in its own right. It is not an action game, even if it offers some, but a game of reflection and rhetoric. It offers us an interesting story that relies on the exploitation of a time portal and philosophical questions that are not without meaning. Even if the charming graphics sometimes lack depth and suffer from insufficiently detailed textures, the faces are neat and the soundtrack is good."
583,21,The Forgotten City,78,Riot Pixels,"Oct 17, 2021","Modern Storyteller did right by rewriting its popular mod for a new world. Aside from some rookie mistakes and an apparent lack of budget, the story is exciting and memorable, and I really did not want to leave this cursed city. I definitely wouldn’t mind a few additional quests."
584,21,The Forgotten City,78,Multiplayer.it,"Jul 27, 2021","The Forgotten City is a great game, even more if you think it's built by 3 people. They deserve more credit and more money, because this game is full of good ideas and a very interesting lore."
585,21,The Forgotten City,75,Noisy Pixel,"Jul 28, 2021","The Forgotten City brings out the adventurer in all of us and showcases just how capable mods can be. While the runtime is kept short, multiple endings increased replay value for a few more days spent in the ruins. In addition, there’s an impressive degree of detail put into these characters that only falters in some aspects of the general gameloop. Regardless, I’m looking forward to what this game encourages modders to produce in the future."
586,21,The Forgotten City,73,New Game Network,"Aug  3, 2021","The Forgotten City succeeds at drawing you into a mystery and using time travel mechanics very effectively. As a narrative adventure, its strong cast and engaging setting help bring the city to life. The game may not always look great and some of the endings are rather abrupt, but it's a trip back in time worth taking."
587,21,The Forgotten City,70,GameCritics,"Aug 18, 2021","The Forgotten City is quite interesting as a new release that’s actually an enhanced and expanded mod that retains all of its key elements while being offered to players who might not be familiar with Skyrim. Despite the performance issues, it’s an adventure that will fascinate until the end, and the riddle surrounding The Golden Rule is one worth solving."
588,21,The Forgotten City,70,Slant Magazine,"Jul 27, 2021","The game handily transcends its mod origins and tells an ambitious and thought-provoking story, but it eventually reaches a point where it doesn’t seem sure how to end."
589,21,The Forgotten City,70,Hardcore Gamer,"Jul 27, 2021",For all its occasional grievances — that don’t add up to too much — it’s the intriguing mystery as much the appeal of its investigative leads across many a conversation where the strengths of The Forgotten City end up standing out most of all.

591,22,Tales of Arise,90,Windows Central,"Sep  9, 2021","Tales of Arise sets a new gold standard for traditional action JRPGs. This stylized adventure's presentation and lavish production is a treat for anime fans and RPG enthusiasts, and it brings new life to the long-running Tales series."

The reworked combat mechanics aren't perfect, but in the grand scheme of things that doesn't matter.

596,22,Tales of Arise,85,Hooked Gamers,"Sep 13, 2021","Tales of Arise is a solid entry into the series, yet I would be wary about recommending it to new players. Sure, you get some nice gameplay refinements and flashy graphics (indeed, it’s probably the best-looking game in the series hands down) but it hardly seems worth the $60 price tag, at least not when previous entries regularly go on sale $8 - $15. As I mentioned above, not that much has changed with the Tales series over the years, so there’s no reason to start with the newest and most expensive entry. However, if you’ve played and enjoyed previous entries in past, Tales of Arise becomes an easy recommendation as it showcases much of what makes the franchise so charming."
597,22,Tales of Arise,85,Jeuxvideo.com,"Sep  8, 2021","Tales of Arise brilliantly succeeds in breathing new life into the Tales Of saga. With its universe and its successful characters, the title delivers a striking adventure that takes advantage of superb environments thanks to a unique graphic rendering. The fights are not left out either since they show great intensity with always more spectacle, sometimes even if it means confusing the action. If we can blame it for his clipping, its talkative side, or its redundant bestiary, we still salute its many qualities which suggest good for the future of the series."
598,22,Tales of Arise,80,PCMag,"Sep 29, 2021","The Tales series makes a triumphant return with Arise, a game that delivers excellent, highly polished RPG action that stands above its predecessors.

599,22,Tales of Arise,80,Ragequit.gr,"Sep 24, 2021","Tales of Arise is a strong addition to the ""Tales of..."" series that will surely satisfy those looking for a worthwhile JRPG experience. However, we must point out the timidity shown in not innovating and limiting itself to a standard scenario and a predictable structure. Perhaps that's why people love the series: because they know what to expect. So, if you do too, feel free to invest in Tales of Arise."
600,22,Tales of Arise,80,Hey Poor Player,"Sep 17, 2021","While it doesn’t end as well as it begins, Tales of Arise told a story I wanted to see through. Even when the plot dipped a bit in the back half, the wonderful cast of characters kept me engaged. Its combat never stopped being a blast either. This is the strongest Tales game in years and definitely worth checking out if you’re looking for a new adventure."
601,22,Tales of Arise,80,Dexerto,"Sep 13, 2021","With its unique cast of characters, stunning watercolor world, and meaty combat system – Tales of Arise is a must-play for any JRPG fan.

605,23,Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy,90,GameSkinny,"Jan 26, 2021","Atelier Ryza 2 improves on the original in almost every way and, despite a few stumbling points, proves Gust is still one of the best at making something magical out of ordinary things. Atelier Ryza 2 does a lot of things right. But even with the much more engaging combat, better environments, and skill tree reward system, it is, surprisingly, the story and characters that kept me coming back for more."
606,23,Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy,90,RPG Fan,"Jan 26, 2021","Longtime fans of the Atelier series will find a lot to love in Atelier Ryza 2. New fans who started with its predecessor also will be pleased to know that the sequel more than lives up to expectations. My initial impressions of the game were quite positive and full of hope, and I’m happy to say that Ryza 2 delivers on nearly every front. A wonderful art style, a touching story, a fantastic combat system, an intuitive alchemy system, a stunningly gorgeous soundtrack, and a bevy of new systems go a long way in making this not only one of the best Atelier games in the series, but one of Gust’s best games."
607,23,Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy,90,RPG Site,"Jan 26, 2021","It's mind-boggling just how much Gust managed to squeeze into Ryza 2 with such a short time budget; the increased scope, both in terms of gameplay mechanics as well as the presentation, is nothing to scoff at. While not all of the changes will necessarily gel with every Atelier player, they clearly build upon the goals that Gust had set for themselves with the first game. It ultimately makes Ryza 2 feel much more like a traditional JRPG than the first game did, which is sure to appeal to more players - and I don't necessarily think that comes at the expense of what made the Atelier series so unique in the first place. There are moments where you can clearly see the limitations of the game's development shine through - such as with recycled assets - but even then, most of the time Gust manages to contextualize things so that you never really feel like the game was made in such a short timeframe."
608,23,Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy,80,Twinfinite,"Feb  4, 2021","Anyone who loves the Atelier Ryza – or the Atelier series in general – is going to love this game. The slight tweaks that the sequel makes to the combat and alchemy improve upon the already solid fast-paced JRPG turn-based combat known to the series without changing what already worked. Combine that with the vast setting and all there is to do in it, and you’ve got a solid recipe for an Atelier title."
609,23,Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy,80,Wccftech,"Jan 31, 2021","Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy marks the very first direct sequel in Atelier's twenty-three years old history. Bringing back Reisalin Stout makes perfect sense and the game benefits from Reisalin and her cheery cast of compatriots. With a light-hearted story taking you on an adventure in a genuinely great-looking and enjoyable to explore environments, you'll also find yourself pulled in by an enhanced battle system, made even more tactical than before. The constantly returning alchemy is also joined by a system that I'm going to call memory archaeology, helping to develop the new main character as well as the history of the game's world. Either way, this is a very enjoyable outing and one that will no doubt keep Reisalin as a fan-favourite character in what is arguably one of, if not the best game in the Atelier series."
610,23,Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy,80,Gamer Escape,"Jan 26, 2021","Much like the original, I found myself having a great time with Ryza 2. As I mentioned back then, if this is the direction the Atelier series is moving in, you can count me in as a fan from this point. While the question remains if Gust will stick with this formula when they eventually move away from titles staring Ryza, I personally hope they continue to revise and refine this model. If Ryza 1 caught my interest, then Ryza 2 definitely has my attention."
611,23,Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy,75,PC Invasion,"Jan 26, 2021","Atelier Ryza 2 has great crafting and combat. But that's because it mostly copies and pastes them from the last game. There's still some new stuff to see and the game is enjoyable regardless, but don't expect them to reinvent the wheel. Mostly, expect the same wheel."

613,24,Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon,95,God is a Geek,"Dec 12, 2021","With hugely varied gameplay and compelling Roguelike elements, Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon is a contender for greatest ever puzzle game."
614,24,Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon,90,Hardcore Gamer,"Dec 15, 2021","Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon may seem like a minor yet unexpected twist for the franchise, but it’s a twist that pays off big time. The core gameplay is easy to get into, but you quickly discover that there’s a deeper level of strategy required, and the next thing you know, you’re on a streak of multiple runs, trying to get past that one particular level. Throw in multiple characters with different playstyles that allow for variety, amazing graphics and a nice chuck of stuff to unlock, and you have a true gem, be it roguelikes or puzzle games (or both) that you prefer. Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon might be a pocket-sized dungeon, but there’s a huge amount of fun in it."
615,24,Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon,90,Shacknews,"Dec 13, 2021","Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon is an easy game to misjudge. It would be simple to dismiss it as a casual puzzle game. It is far from that. This game is as deceptively difficult as it is engaging. The difficulty level may even turn off those just looking for a relaxing romp. However, for those looking for more teeth to their puzzle games, Pocket Dungeon is going to offer that in spades... or shovels."
616,24,Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon,90,NME,"Dec 12, 2021","Despite tackling a completely different genre, Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon shows this franchise is still at its peak. A must-play for fans of the original and puzzle games alike, some inventive mechanics help make it truly special to experience. Even if there are a couple of small issues."
617,24,Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon,90,Screen Rant,"Dec 12, 2021","It's not often that a falling block puzzler can capture the imagination, but Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon finds a buried nugget of novelty in this well-worn ground. Even though it's possible to blast through the adventure, most players will find that savoring the gameplay and enjoying their time with the noble knights is the right call. Pocket Dungeon feels of a kind with Nintendo's various Mario spinoffs and should be an essential purchase for not just fans of the series but puzzle gaming aficionados everywhere."
618,24,Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon,85,Gamers Heroes,"Jan  2, 2022","Methodical puzzle games and frenzied roguelikes sound like apples and oranges, but Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon makes a delicious smoothie out of the two genres suitable for all tastes."

620,24,Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon,85,CGMagazine,"Dec 12, 2021","Shovel Knight: Pocket Dungeon is a truly delightful puzzle/rogue-lite game that is dripping with personality and fun to be had.

622,24,Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon,80,Hobby Consolas,"Dec 13, 2021","Pocket Dungeon is a little and wonderful surprise, a puzzle game that finds its own way mixing itself with elements from dungeon games. It's easy to play, harder to master. For some, the worst part will be the roguelike nature of its challenge, something that won't conquer everyone."
623,24,Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon,80,Hey Poor Player,"Dec 13, 2021","Ultimately, Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon is a great success. It managed to meld a classic indie series with a dynamic new style, and for the most part, it works pretty well. Yes, it may be a bit too challenging for its own good, but not so much I ever put it down for long. If you’re a fan of the series or just enjoy new puzzle games, I’d definitely check it out. Besides the main adventure, there’s a ton of other modes to explore, as well as secrets to uncover. Here’s hoping the next offshoot title from Yacht Club Games continues this positive trend."
624,24,Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon,80,Siliconera,"Dec 12, 2021","Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon is a game that manages to feel both carefree and thoughtful. It is easy to run through each level. You know time is at a premium. You have an idea of what your characters can do. But at the same time, success comes from planning ahead. Being careful and biding your time can be critical. Given that you can be in and out of an area in minutes, it keeps things from getting stale. But that swiftness makes repeated runs even more inviting as you search for answers and secrets."
625,24,Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon,80,IGN,"Dec 12, 2021","The folks at Yacht Club Games continue their streak of hits when it comes to Shovel Knight. As a puzzle game Pocket Dungeon treads familiar ground, but does so in a way that feels completely unique, whether as a fan of Shovel Knight, roguelites, or block-falling games. Some of the roguelite elements feel underdeveloped, and an online versus mode really would have pushed it over the top, but even with those minor shortcomings, this is yet another excellent entry in the world of Shovel Knight."

629,25,Griftlands,90,IGN,"Jun 13, 2021","This ingenious blend of RPG mechanics, visual novel-style storytelling, and deck-building roguelike gameplay is a beautiful recipe for a kind of game I never knew I wanted.  Even though I’ve already spent the past week getting through each of Griftlands’ campaigns multiple times, I’m still looking forward to my next run – and the run after that. Campaigns are short and challenging, making them highly replayable and memorable adventures that reward your time. It’s kinda absurd that such an eclectic group of mechanics work together in such harmony, but once you’re bitten by their charms it’s quite hard to put Griftlands down."
630,25,Griftlands,90,Screen Rant,"Jun 11, 2021","Griftlands does what it sets out to do, offering a wholly compelling and unique take on its genre influences. It's yet another excellent entry into roguelike deckbuilding experiences and is immediately memorable thanks to its reliance on world-building and character depth. Even better, the story of Griftlands is a fun jaunt through a sci-fi world that is buoyed by an even more exciting card game. Those who loved Hades, Slay the Spire, or similar games will find just as much to love in Griftlands."
631,25,Griftlands,86,The Games Machine,"Jun  7, 2021",Griftlands is an atypical deckbuilding roguelite with an addictive gameplay formula and a top notch narrative. I can see myself playing this game for a very long time while trying to master everyone of its aspects.
632,25,Griftlands,85,The Indie Game Website,"Jul  9, 2021","I really like how the deck-building mechanics reflect the dispositions of the different characters. You can see this in both combat and negotiation; Sal is pretty strong all around, which makes them a good choice for your first couple of runs. Rook flips a coin every now and then during negotiation that can produce a powerful boost. Smith builds up a stockpile of empty bottles while in combat which they sometimes hurl at their opponents. The result is a wonderful sense of ludonarrative consonance."

636,25,Griftlands,80,PC Gamer,"Jun 22, 2021","Shortcomings aside, Griftlands is another slice of low-key brilliance from developers Klei. Is there a genre they can't do? The balance of narrative and deck-building made for a much more engaging experience than I often have with card-based titles, even if it feels like more could be done to connect those systems and bolster the storytelling. Still, I'm going to remember my adventures with Sal and the little moments of friendship and betrayal throughout each run. I like playing as a grifter; it ain't much but it's a living."
637,26,Fuga: Melodies of Steel,100,Gamer Escape,"Jul 30, 2021","Fuga: Melodies of Steel is perhaps one of the most impactful games I’ve ever played. The story and gameplay both serve to complement each other, with the story adding so much importance to your decisions, but with the horrible impact of firing the cannon entirely within your power to prevent if you pay attention to all your options. I don’t know if my experience will match everyone else’s, but I sincerely and genuinely felt something from this, and sometimes it just feels good to have something connect with you even as it hurts."

It feels like something I never could have anticipated playing, but it works. The characters are likeable, the gameplay is engaging, and I felt genuinely awful when something terrible happened to one of my charges. It's the rare game that comes out of left field and does most things right, and if you're a fan of JRPGs, you'll find a whole lot to enjoy with Fuga. Just … don't use the Soul Cannon, please."
639,26,Fuga: Melodies of Steel,90,Hey Poor Player,"Aug  6, 2021","From the beautiful art and ethereal music to the addicting gameplay and loveable cast, Fuga: Melodies of Steel is easy to recommend to any fan of turn-based, strategy RPGs. It’s got everything that players love mechanically, but it’s blended in such a fun and innovative way that it feels simultaneously fresh and familiar. Complete with an invigorating story set against a soundtrack that was more like .hack// than anything I’d heard in a long time (felt indescribably amazing to listen to),  Fuga: Melodies of Steel should absolutely be on your radar. Just… try not to use the Soul Cannon; yeeting four year olds at enemies does not for a good war strategy make."

I always hoped it would be great, and my impressions of the game two years ago at AnimeExpo made me sure that the game was on the right track – but you’ll never truly know how a game will land until you’ve had a chance to sit down and play the whole thing for yourself. I can only hope that Fuga is the start of a grand new chapter in CyberConnect2’s journey as a developer, as their team has showcased some serious chops when it comes to designing an RPG."

Every moment of gameplay is emotionally charged with added choices that weigh on the player’s experience and alter the conclusion. The puzzle-esque battle system is addictive but introduces repetitive scenarios and random difficulty spikes depending on your actions. However, this beautiful story deserves to be experienced by all."

Despite the flagrant nature of its technical and budgetary restrictions, CyberConnect2's tactical RPG does well and manages to embark on its experience by making us forget almost all of its shortcomings, moreover few in number. However, there remains a redundancy of actions to be carried out with difficulty compensated by the introduction of new elements, but nothing that is not able to put off fans of tactical role-playing games with a good depth, in search of an accessible title which will know punctually resist them."

On the one hand, I’m glad to see that the Little Tail Bronx series still has life in it. On the other hand, this latest entry is largely unimpressive and doesn’t hold a candle to the rollicking good times that Tail Concerto and Solatorobo were. If you are already a Little Tail Bronx die-hard, then you’ve already decided to buy Fuga: Melodies of Steel.

The style of gameplay is simple, allowing you to enjoy the art, music and especially the writing even more. It will feed you that good mix of absurd and self-aware comedy that you didn’t even know you were hungry for. I really do encourage you to give it a go, especially if you’re on the fence about point and click adventures in general. It’s a game that doesn’t need a triple-A status or heavy content to be fantastic. Just a few sentient pixels, great writing and some paranormal cases to solve."

More is on the way, as well, so for those who worry we’ll be waiting another three or four years for Francis and Dooley to return, fear not. As for me, I’m okay with the break if it means an assurance of quality in the future."

657,27,The Darkside Detective: A Fumble in the Dark,80,The Indie Game Website,"Apr 19, 2021","The tale’s comedic tone and the dialogue are clever and snarky. Coupled with the supernatural shenanigans manifesting daily in the world of The Darkside Detective, these often lead to hilarious situations and reactions from the characters in them, among whom are skeptics to the authenticity of these happenings. Yet the jokes fall short at times due to unnecessarily exaggerated scenes, such as a squirrel planning a heist to a television station. Conversely, it is when The Darkside Detective takes itself a bit more seriously and embraces its deeper, darker roots, that the brilliance truly happens."

The stakes in games often lie in winning or losing a fight and having to expend more personal time on a fight that bruised our egos. Here, we have the added layer of humble automaton friends’ lives hanging by a thread. Even though I found several secrets throughout my initial trek, I am absolutely certain more can be uncovered; I just might take a rare plunge into New Game+."

Its combat and exploration are rewarding, the presentation is stylishly retro, and the narrative is good enough to round out the package.

Not in the layout itself, although it's always rewarding to pull off a Tetris with your possessions, but in understanding where the developers of Witch Beam are taking us and how. Without saying a word, delicately, with devastating attention to detail and a sublime atmosphere, the game tells us a very true story, which we easily cling to.

The fact that it accomplishes this without a line of text or speech is really impressive. Just when you think you can predict which item’s next, you’re hit in the gut with a relic of unexpected meaning and charm.

There’s a place for everything, and it’s up to you to put it in that place. There’s no rush. Enjoy looking at what the person accumulated. Think about what certain items mean. Hope that they find happiness in each new place. Then, if you feel like you need to calm down or want to enjoy the art again, head back and do things different next time."
687,29,Unpacking,80,Screen Rant,"Nov  1, 2021","From the tiniest details in each item to the massive story told through simple gameplay, Unpacking is a fantastic indie game. The relaxing gameplay and chill music create a nice getaway experience. It's easy to disappear into Unpacking and complete the entire game in one playthrough, but the experience is so satisfying that players will want to do it again and again."
688,29,Unpacking,80,Stevivor,"Nov  1, 2021","These little niggles aside, a stellar soundtrack from Jeff van Dyck helps to create a sense of calm and zen (that I can only maintain myself for one or two levels at time) as you continue to play voyeur and peek into the lives of the silent protagonist and their loved ones. The anxiety of moving prevents Unpacking from being something I would get stress relief from, but I nonetheless find myself returning again and again to continue its story."
689,29,Unpacking,80,Checkpoint Gaming,"Nov  1, 2021","Unpacking is a game about making a space your own, taking space up, and making space for others. Each of the game’s levels is a loveable snapshot of believable modern human life. Brisbane-based developer Witch Beam have made a delightful game that I know fans of Aussie indies have been looking forward to for a long time. It isn’t just a fantasy where I’m more organised than in my real life, it’s a relaxing, stress-free experience that I will definitely revisit."
690,29,Unpacking,80,GameSkinny,"Nov  1, 2021","Unpacking is something I play when other games are too stressful or busy to suit my mood. It's a concept I'd never have thought would make for such a rewarding experience, but beyond its simple premise is a story of interesting people and gameplay that inventively combines the homemaking of The Sims with the light-puzzling of a point-and-click."
691,29,Unpacking,75,PC Invasion,"Nov  1, 2021","Cute, charming, and surprisingly satisfying, Unpacking scratches an itch that no other game attempts. But it's also too bossy for its own good at times."
692,29,Unpacking,70,GameCritics,"Jan  3, 2022","In the end, Unpacking is completely fine. It’s a three or four-hour experience of going through a life via boxes, and the believable, realistic narrative that unfolds. It’s recommended as a nice break from more taxing titles, but I still wish there was much more to… unpack."
693,29,Unpacking,55,GameSpace,"Dec  1, 2021","Do you remember what you saw in this game? The unboxing will be no less for me than the last superhero movie I watched.

694,30,Everhood,90,CD-Action,"Nov 15, 2021","Chris Nordgren and Jordi Roca created something unique and delightful. Everhood’s music-based combat system is absolutely brilliant in its simplicity and addictive as hell, the soundtrack is stellar, and I enjoyed the surreal atmosphere and the story which often breaks the fourth wall. It’s a gem you should definitely play. [05/2021, p.30]"
695,30,Everhood,90,GamingTrend,"Mar 31, 2021",Everhood is a fantastic freshman effort that brings unexpected and refreshing spins to both the RPG and rhythm genre. The creative combat system and repeat-friendly soundtrack are definitely strong points but the thought-provoking story elevates the unusual adventure to excellent heights.
696,30,Everhood,90,The Games Machine,"Mar 18, 2021","Everhood is simply incredible. A carnival populated by masks that have lost their humanity, a deep, rich tale, enhanced by a gameplay that mixes rhythm game, adventure and RPG. A gem that deserves to be played by as many people as possible."
697,30,Everhood,90,Hardcore Gamer,"Mar 15, 2021","Do not under any circumstances give this one a miss: Everhood is likely to be one of the most surprising, smart and moving games to surface in 2021."
698,30,Everhood,90,Screen Rant,"Mar  4, 2021","All in all, Everhood is a darling of an indie game. It certainly lends more than a quick footnote to Undertale, both in terms of its atmosphere and its themes and storytelling. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, however, and its music-based action is an absolute wonder."
699,30,Everhood,85,Noisy Pixel,"Mar  8, 2021","Overall, if I had to describe Everhood in a single word, it’d be “experiment.” It’s a game that tests interesting concepts to become its own thing. Combining adventure with RPG-Esque mechanics and an enjoyable take on rhythm combat that offers a unique experience for any looking for something new."

It’s a philosophical and very human history, even if the supporting characters are not up to the standard. The playability, with a significant original soundtrack, is also one-of-a-kind."
704,31,Final Fantasy IV Pixel Remaster,92,RPG Fan,"Sep 13, 2021","Even 30 years after release, Final Fantasy IV still shines as brightly as it did in 1991. Its genre-defining story and combat system coupled with the Pixel Remaster’s reorchestrated soundtrack and quality of life updates make this an iconic game you’d be a fool to miss. Much like Cecil struggles with his unwitting role as a killer for his king, I struggle to let go of Final Fantasy IV Pixel Remaster after spending a few dozen hours wrapping up its main quest. If you have even a modicum of affection for JRPGs, you will too."
705,31,Final Fantasy IV Pixel Remaster,90,Hey Poor Player,"Oct  1, 2021","Final Fantasy IV was a great game when it came out in 1991, and, 30 years later, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster is just as great. The only thing, in my opinion, that could have made this game better would have been the inclusion of the Lunar Subterrain from Final Fantasy IV Advance. But, hey, “almost perfect” is still pretty good, too. Whether you’re a Final Fantasy veteran or are looking to get your feet wet, I can’t recommend Final Fantasy IV Pixel Remaster enough."
706,31,Final Fantasy IV Pixel Remaster,90,CGMagazine,"Sep  8, 2021","Final Fantasy IV Pixel Remaster is a nigh-definitive rebuild of an essential entry in the series, revitalized with a new presentation and only lacking the bonus endgame content of other ports."
707,31,Final Fantasy IV Pixel Remaster,90,Hardcore Gamer,"Sep  8, 2021","Final Fantasy IV is one of the best 16-bit RPGs with a strong story that holds up after all these years. Even though the turn-based combat and exploration with random encounters may seem simple compared to modern games, it’s still an enjoyable fourteen hour playthrough. This may not have been the remake everyone was hoping for, but Final Fantasy IV Pixel Remaster is a great version of a great game."
708,31,Final Fantasy IV Pixel Remaster,80,GamingTrend,"Nov 17, 2021","While the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters aren’t perfect, they’re certainly the best and most convenient ways to play these classic games. The soundtracks are lovingly orchestrated and the pixel art is gorgeous, though the latter does lose some detail in the translation. Each game feels great to play, but I do wish extra content from previous releases or remakes had been included."
709,31,Final Fantasy IV Pixel Remaster,80,Jeuxvideo.com,"Sep 19, 2021","It’s not being weak to pounce on Final Fantasy IV once again. Introducing a dramatic dimension that was lacking in the first episodes of the saga, this adventure crosses the generations without taking a wrinkle. For this Pixel Remaster iteration, Square-Enix remains true to its line of conduct, finding an interesting balance between past and present. Charming and exciting, the game would however have deserved more significant bonuses, such as a small making-of for example. Some may be closed to this less flashy approach than the PSP episode, but Final Fantasy IV, for all that it stands for, remains a staple in Japanese RPGs."
710,31,Final Fantasy IV Pixel Remaster,80,Siliconera,"Sep  8, 2021","Final Fantasy IV Pixel Remaster may initially butt up against your nostalgia if you have fond memories of the original, but over time, I really began to appreciate seeing its visuals and sound explored in creative ways."

712,31,Final Fantasy IV Pixel Remaster,70,Cubed3,"Dec 15, 2021","Final Fantasy IV Pixel Remaster is a stunning update that sings with the bells and whistles of a more modern pixel rendering style. Hindered only by bad font and a small technical issue this is an experience Final Fantasy fans need to have. The story of Cecil is easy to get sucked into, it is backed by some insanely sublime music and the gameplay is a joy, even if it is dated. Only a fool would pass this up!"

716,32,I Expect You To Die 2: The Spy And The Liar,90,Screen Rant,"Aug 24, 2021","From a fantastic opening credits scene performed by Puddles Pity Party to its final exciting moments, I Expect You To Die 2: The Spy and the Liar delivers exactly what fans of the first game have come to expect - a campy spy adventure with increasingly deadly stakes, dramatically elaborate puzzles, and lots of physics objects to pretend to eat or simply throw across the room. For anyone with a fondness for James Bond stories or 1950's noir - and access to a VR headset - The Spy and the Liar is a fantastic choice."
717,32,I Expect You To Die 2: The Spy And The Liar,88,COGconnected,"Aug 31, 2021","The smart, funny Bond-inspired writing, the meticulous attention to detail, the masterful use of Oculus’s VR controls, and the well-designed missions had me … well, glued to my seat the entire time. It may not change much from the original, but I Expect You to Die 2: The Spy and the Liar once again delivers a thoroughly-enjoyable VR experience from start to finish."
718,32,I Expect You To Die 2: The Spy And The Liar,85,Road to VR,"Sep  3, 2021","I Expect You to Die 2 may be more of the same, but it's a good slice of fun, espionage-flavored action that again tasks you with disarming cleverly-designed and deadly puzzles provided by the evil Bond-style Zoraxis corporation. While object interaction isn't the game's strong suit, the sequel offers up a good number of varied levels packed with truly intriguing puzzles, oftentimes containing multiple ways to die that always feel like the joke's on you."

It doesn't do much to evolve in any meaningful way, but it doesn't need to. The great, albeit short, stages are a lot of fun to solve, but they can be frustrating to repeat as you trial-and-error your way through to the final credits. If you loved the first game, this one is sure to please."
720,32,I Expect You To Die 2: The Spy And The Liar,80,PC Invasion,"Aug 31, 2021","Making fantastic use of the VR medium, I Expect You To Die 2 picks up where the original left off, in the most literal sense possible. Sure, it may not be treading any new ground and is somewhat on the brief side, but even when viewing it as an expansion to the original, it still offers a stellar experience for all comers. Rest assured, that mission isn't firing any blanks."

An extra couple of levels would’ve been nice with the possibility of a handy nudge in the right direction yet they’re only minor quibbles. If you’re looking for a VR puzzler that really pushes the technology then this isn’t it, I Expect You To Die 2 is all about playing to the masses and that’s no bad thing either."
722,32,I Expect You To Die 2: The Spy And The Liar,80,IGN,"Aug 24, 2021","I Expect You To Die 2 is a clever, surprising, and fun escape room-style puzzle game that’s certainly worth exploring. You’ll need to stomach a lot of restarts to see it through to the end, but its best interactive moments and its focus on comfort and ease of access make doing so worth dying over and over again for. Regardless, once I’d unraveled everything there was to see across the three-hour campaign, I was left without much to do except hope that an actual spy came along and flashed my memory, Men In Black-style, so I could play the whole thing again with fresh eyes."
723,32,I Expect You To Die 2: The Spy And The Liar,70,TheGamer,"Aug 24, 2021","Sequels are often expected to be bigger and better, but sometimes a good sequel is just more of what made the original geat. I suppose I would have liked to see Schell Games push the mechanics and missions further, but ultimately I’m satisfied to play another round of cleverly designed spy puzzles. It’s not particularly ambitious, but it’s consistently good from beginning to end. If you liked the original, there’s absolutely no way you won’t like I Expect You To Die 2."

Definitely give it a chance, and don’t be discouraged by its difficulty – we’ve all been through it."

It’s amazing that a series that has been so beloved by fans, and has spawned countless spin-offs - some great, and some not so much - has managed to return without feeling any different. It’s like the past 20 years has been one long fever dream for Crash, and he’s now awoken from a deep slumber for one last triumphant return."

730,33,Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time,79,PC Gamer,"Apr  9, 2021","Crash 4 is the kind of retro throwback that actually earns its spot as a successor to the original trilogy. There’s the occasional bandicoot stumble, but it's a responsive, precise platformer that looks as good as it plays."
731,33,Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time,70,Cubed3,"Mar 26, 2021","Crash Bandicoot hasn't changed much, and that's - mostly - a good thing. Some more substantial additions would be more than welcome, as the new things on offer feel underused here - like the mask abilities and the extra playable character, which can only be used in very specific spots and/or levels. The replay value is once again very high, first due to the many collectables, and, second, because of the ""your skill is the limit"" Time Trial mode. As expected, Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time remains as challenging as its older siblings. Mostly because this is…well, Crash Bandicoot, but sadly this also happens because of the much worse perspectives. Fixable by a patch? Hopefully, yes, as it lowers the fun factor quite a bit."

In a constant game of hide-and-seek, the tension is overwhelming, and you feel the weight of every heartbeat or the desperate gasping of enemies over your shoulder. Unfortunately, it's a short experience, much along the lines of the first in the series, and although it doesn't completely eliminate the weak points, it grabs on to its strong points in a sublime way."

You’ll feel compelled to keep pushing forward, as much to help Mono escape from this world as to discover the mystery behind the Signal Tower. Death awaits around every corner, but I felt that each death was a learning experience more than it was a source of frustration. After each one, I learned a little something, be it when to swing a pipe, where to make a jump, what to avoid knocking over, or that loose floorboards are probably a trigger for a trap. And with each death I picked myself up and pushed further on, because I had to see how this nightmare ended."

The folks at Tarsier Studios have expanded on the story and lore with new characters and settings, added gameplay mechanics that don’t overcomplicate the action or bloat the pacing, and proven themselves worryingly imaginative when it comes to thinking up dastardly denizens of a perfectly grim world."
765,34,Little Nightmares II,70,Edge Magazine,"Feb 25, 2021","Little Nightmares 2 is a slight dispersal of the original's concepts, adding some fabulous locations and grotesqes without cleaning up the platforming or developing a soul of its own, but it's in some ways a more complex horror story.

766,34,Little Nightmares II,70,GameSpot,"Feb 18, 2021","Little Nightmares II is a delightfully spooky foray into a horrifyingly gorgeous world. It's also a bit too long, occasionally frustrating and, in one key moment, inaccessible for players who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. But, overall, it represents a successful follow-up from Tarsier. With inventive puzzle design and some startlingly original levels, it isn't quite a dream come true, but it certainly won't have you waking up, bolt upright, screaming, in a cold sweat."
767,34,Little Nightmares II,70,GameCrate,"Feb  9, 2021","Little Nightmares II is just a worse game than the original. Everything they added to the system feels clunky at best and unfair at worst.

Beautiful, immersive, and dynamic, I can’t recommend this game enough."
772,35,Kena: Bridge of Spirits,90,PC Games,"Sep 21, 2021","The compact game plays consistently excellently, because no gameplay element seems superimposed and the feeling of progress is so successful precisely because Kena focuses on the essentials. Only on the story level was I left a little disappointed. The game makes an effort to touch the player emotionally, but it didn't really work out because the story and characters are shifted a little too much into the background. Nevertheless, the gameplay and presentation are so successful that they easily carry Kena over its ten to fifteen hour runtime and keeps me waiting eagerly for the studio's next project."

And this is perhaps its biggest strength: a relaxing game, with a challenge, that you want to finish at 100%. In the end, Kena doesn't invent much but offers a beautiful and memorable journey."

If the breathtaking visuals don’t suck you in, then there’s the satisfying and challenging combat as well, or the wide world to explore. Or maybe you just want to find all the teeny hats for the Rot in order to make them as ridiculously adorable as possible. Whatever the case, there’s going to be something satisfying for everyone here in Kena’s debut."

Combining all the best of tactical board game combat, deck-building, and narrative, this game is a contender for best roguelikes available right now. It does have some flaws that keep me from recommending it categorically, but nothing that overwhelms the depth of strategy at play here. I have long been starved as a fan of turn-based combat, and Trials of Fire has finally erupted from the depths of the earth to satisfy that need."
783,36,Trials of Fire,90,Gaming Nexus,"Apr 16, 2021","Trials of Fire is a fantastic deck-building game. It is enhanced by also acting like a rouguelike for endless replayability, and it crafts a rich world around its characters. Trials of Fire only disappoints on one front: that the story it actually tells seems more like a teaser than an epic. While I can't complain in that it is priced like a single episode in a longer saga, I am left wanting for the rest of the saga. Maybe that's altogether not the worst thing..."
784,36,Trials of Fire,90,Hey Poor Player,"Apr 13, 2021","Trials of Fire just has so much to offer. Addicting combat, awesome art style, old-school charm, near endless amounts of replayability, and just tons of unique options. Couple that with the option to tailor your experience to your own time limits, and there’s very little not to love. Honestly, as I said before, my sole criticism of this game is that it presents the narrative in an okay-ish format. But it’s easily forgiven with the sheer amount of everything else available."

It’s also very tough as many encounters spawn a random number of enemies. Trials of Fire’s card system makes being outnumbered feel a little unfair at times too, as the opponent has more cards to work with, as well as more potential mana, more armor, and more movement to gain from discarding them. However, its smart mechanics, survival play, and deck-building make up for any criticisms I have leveled at it. I’ll definitely dive back in for another adventure before too long, though perhaps on a lower difficulty…"

That time spent listening to player feedback was used wisely, and balancing, tone, and innovation have all been tweaked with a deft hand. While some of its elements shine more brightly than others, and the more involved nature of the game means it's a tougher sell for players looking to rapid-fire their way through its learning curve and combinations, Trials of Fire leaves Early Access as yet another strong, captivating deckbuilding game that borrows from tabletop roleplaying games and roguelites to carve out a name for itself."

This game would also be a great place for players to return to as a quick-fix to relax. That said, I think to keep Sunlight impactful and interesting over a longer haul, updating the stories would be needed. Overall, Sunlight is worth the short time it takes to complete and makes for the ultimate respite if you need somewhere to restore your thoughts. Even without the visuals, the music and story combined are enough to create a perfect nest that embodies calm, meditation, and awareness of your body. Given the world we live in right now, Sunlight couldn’t have come at a better time."

Those who brave through the initial confusion, however, will find one of the best computer RPGs released in recent times."

Some of its elements are exceptional, like the overwhelming variety in classes, skills, and ""paths,"" or the general epic aura it has, while some other parts sit somewhere between decent and good, like the story (which is a bit too stereotypical), the Crusade portion of the gameplay (which is a buggy chore), and the actual role-playing, which, while fine and all, won't be enough for those spoiled by other modern classics of the genre. Despite some its flaws, it is undoubtedly very entertaining, and highly recommended, as it will surely satisfy your hunger for a good RPG."

849,40,Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun - Aiko's Choice,82,COGconnected,"Dec  7, 2021","Both new and returning players will be challenged by Aiko’s Choice, but the rewards are worth the effort. Effectively completing the game’s missions is satisfying in the same way as solving a tough puzzle. Added to that are the game’s lovely art and music, a cast of engaging characters, and an interesting story. I suggest playing the base game first, though, if for no other reason than to get up to speed on the mechanics. It’s a shame that Aiko’s Choice doesn’t welcome new players a little more, but those who persevere will be rewarded. For fans of the original, the expansion has been worth the wait."

It builds upon Blades of the Shogun in intriguing ways, and even though its challenge and complexity mirrors the later stages of that game, brevity and instructive level design make Aiko’s Choice uniquely placed to showcase what makes tactical stealth games as engrossing as they can be. For a niche genre that’s not exactly known to be welcoming to newcomers, that’s an impressive feat."

The few issues that you could have with the original, such as the difficulty curve, are made worse due to the location of these missions within the larger story - and with it being standalone - which could make it inaccessible. The lack of introduction to characters, presuming foreknowledge, also means new players will find it hard to get into. Even with these flaws, I could only recommend it as it looks great, sounds great, and plays even better."

On the other hand, there is nothing new in terms of gameplay. This makes it more of a pack of additional missions. That said, the care given to the missions and the richness of the tactical situations allows once again to rack your brains in this excellent infiltration game that is Shadow Tactics."

This is a fantastic package filled with meaningful content: 10 main chapters with a solid script, unexpected twists and a story that, taken together, is interesting and drives you to know more. The period setting and the care taken in integrating geopolitical elements are excellent details. Investigative scenes, deduction sequences, the ability to examine the evidence, and the attention to detail when pressuring witnesses are all too much fun, plus the addition of a jury and the possibility Interrogating multiple witnesses at once puts a fresh spin on the series."

When played back-to-back, you’re looking at around 70 hours of playtime in total, and that isn’t including all the extra content. I’m delighted that I can now go from desperately wanting Capcom to localize the games to desperately wanting Capcom to announce The Great Ace Attorney 3! These games are full of the same over-the-top craziness and heartbreaking melodrama that makes the series so memorable, and I highly recommend it to both long-time fans and those who are simply looking for a fantastic story.

872,42,Resident Evil Village,90,Trusted Reviews,"May  5, 2021","Resident Evil Village is a great horror game that is sure to delight newcomers and old fans of the series. The horror setting has moments that are genuinely terrifying and the game’s narrative feels suitably satisfying, and grotesque, to entice fans of the genre. The only downside is that its increased focus on combat can make it feel a little too easy, even when played on the normal difficulty setting. If you’re looking to experience the true horrors on offer here, I suggest you crank up the difficulty."
873,42,Resident Evil Village,90,Windows Central,"May  5, 2021","Resident Evil Village is one of the first games that feels truly ""next-gen,"" with absolutely stunning tech bolstered by the industry-leading RE Engine. Stunning visuals, truly bizarre creatures, a memorable parade of eccentric characters, and truly satisfying gameplay make Resident Evil Village soar, even if a few quirks in the plot delivery deflate the spectacle. Resident Evil Village is a truly excellent game and one of the best entries in the legendary franchise. Long may it continue."
874,42,Resident Evil Village,90,GameSpot,"May  5, 2021","Resident Evil 7 was an excellent return to the horror underpinnings of the franchise, but cunningly altered with new ideas and a new perspective. Similarly, Village is an intelligent reintroduction of the best action elements of Resident Evil. Though it captures some of the same things that made RE7 such a breath of fresh air (or maybe rancid, stale, mold-filled air, but in a good way), Village evolves to become its own unique creature. It makes you wonder what beautifully twisted fiend Resident Evil might mutate into in the future."

876,42,Resident Evil Village,88,Areajugones,"May 24, 2021","Resident Evil 8 Village becomes one of the best games of 2021 due to a couple of main reasons: first, it polishes the formula of its predecessor, and second, it provides an essence like no other in the whole franchise. Ethan Winters' new adventure is a sublime work that shines whether it is regarding its storytelling or the gameplay; from the characters to the general atmosphere, it manages to entice us from the very first moment, distinguishing itself as a standalone story but, at the same time, finding its place within one of the most relevant IP in the industry."

Thanks to its technique and its story (but not its narration), the latest canonical episode of Capcom's successful license has all the necessary arguments to please both the series' regulars and newcomers. A ten-hour adventure that will give Ethan Winters a run for his money and that we highly recommend."

882,42,Resident Evil Village,83,MMORPG.com,"May 10, 2021","By itself, Resident Evil Village is a fantastic addition to the survival-horror genre and focuses more on empowering the player rather than cheap horror elements. As part of the series, Village lacks in the story department and seems like it tries to cast too wide of a net to appeal to a greater audience rather than catering to the hardcore fans. Diehard ResE fans might be disappointed at the lack of lore in Village, but casual fans won’t feel like they need to have played every prior entry in order to have a good time. Ultimately, I’d recommend Resident Evil Village to anyone that loved Resident Evil 4 or who felt like Resident Evil 7 was too horror-focused."
883,42,Resident Evil Village,80,GameSkinny,"May 17, 2021","The first run through Resident Evil Village is a genuinely thrilling, often scary ride, which draws on a lot of features from the series' greatest hits. It's worth a look for anyone who's ever enjoyed a Resident Evil game or a first-person shooter. The cracks only start to show later on. Village is playable and entertaining, but it lacks some attention to detail when compared to the other mainline entries in the series."
884,42,Resident Evil Village,80,PC Games,"May  5, 2021","Resident Evil: Village is a really weird game. The setting is awesome and it starts off with great atmosphere, but after the first area the game becomes less and less scary. The premise of the game is really interesting, but the story gets dumber and dumber and turns out to be unintentionally funny. At first Village really is the survival horror, fans of the older RE games love, but it becomes almost Call of Duty in the end. Village is not a bad game. In fact I had a lot of fun playing it. It is a bit disappointing since the setting had so much potential for a really scary old school survival horror Resident Evil though. But if you’re looking for a shooter with horror elements, Village is a dumb but super entertaining blockbuster."
885,42,Resident Evil Village,80,PCMag,"May  5, 2021","Resident Evil Village blends Resident Evil 7's grounded horror with Resident Evil 4's fast action and offbeat concepts. More tension, more combat, and more weirdness round out a game whose faults lie on the edges of the overall experience."
886,42,Resident Evil Village,80,Telegraph,"May  5, 2021","Those comparisons to Resident Evil 4 are not entirely unfounded then. It is not as genre-shifting as that game – few games are – but it does share a certain ethos and hunger for variety in tension and action. It is very much its own thing too, both a natural continuation of the series recent reinvention and a manic expansion of its long-standing invention and flamboyance. Most of all, it is a tremendous, and tremendously terrifying, video game in its own right."
887,42,Resident Evil Village,80,Jeuxvideo.com,"May  5, 2021","More accomplished than its predecessor from whom it shamelessly steals its structure, Resident Evil Village is a complete experience filling with quiet strength all the necessary boxes for the success of an action-oriented first-person survival horror. Although it draws its inspiration from the depths of the Spanish oblivion belonging to the fourth installment, the title of Capcom manages to perform well thanks to its atmosphere tinged with original fantasy for the saga. The unforgivable absence of virtual reality and the presence of a feeling of ""already played"", however, prevent him from claiming the title of eminent village chief. Not enough to initiate a parochial dispute, however: this new Resident Evil is a success."

I can’t wait to play Demeo with my regular D&D group as we ease our way back into in-person sessions.

893,43,Demeo,100,UploadVR,"May  6, 2021","Demeo is not a perfect tabletop RPG. Its turn-based combat isn’t especially deep and its difficulty stems from brute force. But it is instantly graspable and endlessly rewarding even when the odds are stacked against you. More importantly, though, it’s a near-peerless social VR experience, polished to such a degree that it transforms the kinks of its systems into enjoyable, suspenseful quirks. Facing its brutish hordes with friends at your side is a thrilling, collaborative endurance test; defeat is met with entertained cries of anguish while victory — rare as that may be — is celebrated with the sort of group-wide elation you might have been missing in this tough past year. Not built for parties of one, then, but if you have a group of three or four ready to raid, Demeo is one of VR’s best."

Combining the VR environment, voice acting, sound effects, and animations make for a great experience, especially when played with friends. While it currently doesn’t replace a tabletop RPG, I can see the potential, and it is a big step in the right direction. With a few balancing tweaks and more updates/content, this will be an amazing game."

As Demeo is entirely tabletop-based there are no comfort issues to worry about (best played seated), plus as you complete runs you level up and unlock new customisation options, encouraging repeat gameplay. Its slower style isn’t for everyone yet as an example of D&D in VR, Demeo excels."

When Demeo adds some essential features, like a level editor or a save function, and some more dungeons, it could become one of the go-to VR experiences for RPG fans. It hasn't reached that lofty goal yet, though."

915,44,Chivalry 2,83,Meristation,"Jun 30, 2021","Chivalry 2 becomes one of the most surprising multiplayer games of last months, with a solid combat and fantastic setting. Only some lack of content -modes, maps- ward the game off a higher point, but Torn Banner is expected to solve this."

918,44,Chivalry 2,80,Gamepressure,"Sep 11, 2021","As is, Chivalry 2 features an immersive Team Objective mode that highlights all the best parts of this online multiplayer. The other two modes are okay in moderation and require you to do more button mashing than the precise motions you thought the game wanted you to perform all along. If you can get past some of its blander parts and focus on the joys of mastering swordplay, Chivalry 2 can be a lot of fun despite its weak spots."
919,44,Chivalry 2,80,Cubed3,"Aug 18, 2021","Chivalry 2 offers up some exciting, large-scale battles, and a variety of melee weapons at the ready. The balance is almost there, with archers perhaps being too powerful due to their generous aiming. The automatic team balancing system does remove some of the pressure of winning or losing, which can be a net positive. So, unleash a battle cry and join the fray!"
920,44,Chivalry 2,80,Vandal,"Jul  1, 2021","This is a fantastic multiplayer with an excellent combat and well design stages. It’s lacking some content, but it’s a matter of time until that it’s fixed."
921,44,Chivalry 2,80,IGN Portugal,"Jun 28, 2021","Alone or with friends, Chivalry 2 is one of the most fun experiences that I had in recent times. It’s incredibly accessible, and brilliantly blends the theatrics of an epic Hollywood movie with humour, while not taking itself too seriously. Even though it has few maps, at least for now, the ones it has are enough to guarantee you countless hours of fun."

Just be mindful of that bloodthirsty knight that spawned right next to you!"
923,44,Chivalry 2,80,PC Invasion,"Jun 22, 2021","Chivalry 2 delivers plenty of intense, blood-soaked action, without taking itself too seriously. But you might eventually want to do more than blindly swing a sword around."
924,44,Chivalry 2,80,Game Rant,"Jun 21, 2021","Those that enjoy games that are bloody, bombastic, and have a pinch of humor will find an excellent experience in Chivalry 2. It's approachable, smooth, and an excellent time with friends. Plus, there's the promise of free content on the horizon, which should make the current offering even more appealing to those that engage with it. While there are some minor technical issues to be sorted out here and there, it's still one of the most enjoyable experiences to come out of 2021 so far."

927,44,Chivalry 2,80,Checkpoint Gaming,"Jun 18, 2021","As is the case with many good multiplayer games, the game itself is well made, but mileage may vary with your actual experience playing it. Mechanically, I was impressed with the depth and breadth of everything that you get to play with. Combat itself is incredibly detailed, and the capabilities to have such a compelling game in a crowd of warring factions is impressive. However, the chaos of the battlefield may be a dealbreaker for you; you may find it compelling, or you may find it frustrating. At best I can say it is part of Chivalry 2’s charm, but I’m not able to say that I always appreciated it. Regardless, the specific flavour of madness it provides makes for a fun, violent time, even amongst the varying degrees of chaos."
928,44,Chivalry 2,80,MMORPG.com,"Jun 17, 2021","Ultimately, I’ve had a blast with Chivalry 2. It improves upon every single aspect of the original game, and feels more stable and polished than Chivalry ever did. There is some jankiness to the game (I’m not sure if the aforementioned self-catapulting is actually supposed to be an option), but it doesn’t take away from the fantastic combat. Getting a kill never gets old, battles are unpredictable and memorable, and there are seemingly endless ways to take down your foes."
929,44,Chivalry 2,80,The Indie Game Website,"Jun 15, 2021","I am in love with Chivalry 2, but it’s not the best it could be just yet. As it stands, the party system is literally useless at the moment. There are also a few connection issues here and there too. However, assuming they get fixed, Chivalry 2 could well be my go-to game for killing a bit of time–and a lot of people–for years to come. The developers will also be adding in horses in a later update, and that sounds truly wonderful."
930,44,Chivalry 2,80,Screen Rant,"Jun 14, 2021","Even if dedicated warriors will have the maps memorized within a few days of play, Chivalry 2 does promise combat that never goes the same way twice. There are truly unique options like launching teammates into the heart of the battlefield with a catapult or grabbing a pitchfork and pushing enemy soldiers off a bridge. The amount of seemingly unique animations meshing together into a cacophony of carnage is the reason that Chivalry 2 truly shines. With some updates and proper mod support, it will easily surpass the first game and its impressive medieval game imitators, and as it stands now, Chivalry 2 is already immense fun."

932,44,Chivalry 2,80,MGG,"Jun 13, 2021","Chivalry II is a game that takes a long time to get used to, but once you've got the basics down, it's possible to have a blast and enjoy the unusual moments offered by the game and especially by the community. It remains accessible to the general public, as dueling and jousting virtuosos will blend in with the masses and it will still be possible to fight between peons without screaming with rage. Chivalry II is graphically beautiful, even if some details could have used a little more polishing, but for an arcade fighting game like this, it's more than enough to fully immerse yourself after a few battles."
933,44,Chivalry 2,80,PCGamesN,"Jun 11, 2021","A first-person slasher for Monty Python fans rather than reenactors, Chivalry 2's unswerving dedication to fun and goofiness makes it a rare treat in modern multiplayer gaming."
934,44,Chivalry 2,70,PC Games,"Jun 29, 2021","Chivalry 2 successfully captures the chaos and brutality of big medieval battles, and manages to spice up the bloodbath with some much needed humor through its whacky sandbox-elements and absurd war-cries. The fantastic-feeling combat-system is in a league of its own, especially on console. However, the game lacks the necessary variety of maps and modes to offer a long-term experience that goes beyond chaotic, somewhat mindless action. Eight maps and three modes, all of which quickly turn into chaotic mayhem, is all you´re getting at the moment, diabolically fun as it may be for a few hours. The gameplay foundation is excellent, but Torn Banner Studios needs to quickly add maps, modes, and enticing goals for players to really sink their teeth into, otherwise Chivalry 2 might quickly fade into obscurity."
935,44,Chivalry 2,70,Gameblog.fr,"Jun 16, 2021","Chivalry 2 is an enjoyable experience. The fun is omnipresent, and you can feel the mastery of your character and your weapon during all your progression. Unfortunately, many bugs (completely broken social system and multiple crashes) destroy the experience. Wait for a patch."
936,44,Chivalry 2,70,Hardcore Gamer,"Jun 15, 2021","While the content is short sighted with Chivalry 2, the improvements over its predecessor make it a much better experience. As of today, developer Torn Banner Studios has promised that the content in the game will double. The combat is fun and the draw to keep playing is to level up each subclass, while the archer provides a good change of pace. This is an excellent title to play a couple of rounds and come back to at another date. Those that want to grind and get skilled have the chance to do this. For PC players, the keyboard and mouse combo works well with the combat mechanics. As more and more content comes to the game including gameplay improvements, the experience should only improve. Either way, it’s hard to put the game down."
937,44,Chivalry 2,60,NME,"Jun 16, 2021","Chivalry 2 is a rambunctious, bloody, and slapstick multiplayer action game that is perhaps a little bit chaotic for its own good. With a deep combat system that doesn’t get a proper showing due to a lack of a duelling mode, and a proliferation of archers who sap a lot of the fun out of the game’s messy brawls, Chivalry 2 is a hair away from being great. Whether it stands the test of time will depend on how much attention Torn Banner gives it over time."

Fast, colorful, easy to play if you just want to see the end, and absolutely challenging if you try to fully complete it unlocking every secret. The gameplay is not that innovative, and sometimes borrows heavily from the classics, but the result is an undeniably competent game. If you like platformers, there is no reason in the world not to try it. Highly recommended."
939,45,Kaze and the Wild Masks,85,PC Invasion,"Mar 19, 2021","While on the short side and not particularly original, Kaze and the Wild Masks is an exceptional 2D platformer filled with well designed, engaging levels and tight, responsive controls."

943,45,Kaze and the Wild Masks,80,Game Rant,"Apr  6, 2021","Kaze and the Wild Masks is exceptionally average in every way, and never fails to impress.

944,45,Kaze and the Wild Masks,80,GameOver.gr,"Apr  2, 2021","Kaze and the Wild Masks is 10% a nostalgic trip to platformers of the 16-bit era and 90% an ode to Donkey Kong Country from the SNES. It is full of charm, with a vibrant and detailed pixel art and with simplistic, albeit satisfying gameplay. Fans of linear 2D platformers that focus on platforming could not find a safer option for their next purchase."
945,45,Kaze and the Wild Masks,79,Ragequit.gr,"Mar 21, 2021","Kaze and the Wild Masks draws heavy inspirations from 90's platform games and especially the Donkey Kong Country trilogy.

It would’ve been easy to have this be the most bombastic entry of the series and have all the series fan favorites show up, however the fact that a majority of characters involved are mostly new allows you to really focus on Kiryu’s final story. We’re not gonna sugar coat that a new hero has already risen and has held his own, however it is heartening that the series has gotten enough support that it has finally escaped the PlayStation ecosystem and can be enjoyed by gamers everywhere!"

The two years that passed since its launch on Sony consoles has provided it with technical improvements that, especially on PC, made the game’s visuals more in line with the times. Compared to Yakuza 0, the combat is a bit on the stiffer side, but still satisfying, and Yakuza 6 is a worthy final chapter in a fifteen-year long narrative arc."

However, as an installment of the Yakuza series, Yakuza 6 reaches new heights. The upgrade to the Dragon Engine set the stage for triumphs yet to come (including Yakuza Kiwami 2, Judgment, and Yakuza: Like a Dragon), and the game is an overall joy to play. It may be bittersweet to be leaving the Dragon of Dojima’s shoes, but I have no doubts that there will be several return journeys to the streets of Kamurocho in the future!"

While it's not without its shortcomings - in particular, a bit less variety in combat and puzzles than the genre often typifies - where it shines, it does so brightly. For RPG fans, Eastward is the real deal, and it’s an unmissable and impressive feat of indie design that deserves plenty of recognition amongst a sea of bigger releases in 2021."
964,48,Eastward,95,Noisy Pixel,"Sep 20, 2021","Eastward will fulfill any action-adventure needs that have been missing in your life.

It is plain as day that Pixpil poured their affections for this genre into making this game. They’ve provided fluid and expressive animation rarely seen in pixel games, lively characters, quirky writing, and catchy chiptune soundtracks. It is visually enticing from the beginning and will continue to keep you hooked until you are satisfied with unravelling its narrative. Eastward has easily taken its place as my favourite game of this year. I highly encourage lovers of pixel JRPGs to try this game out for yourselves. John and Sam will cook you up a satisfying adventure you will want to devour whole."

At times, I wondered if the experience would be enhanced playing Eastward sitting cross-legged on the floor in front of a giant CRT television, tethered way to close to the screen by a wired controller. For gamers of a certain age, Eastward feels an awful lot like home, and one I didn’t realize I missed so dearly."

Don't call it Zelda-like: not because it's not a formally correct definition but because Pixpil's creature wants to be something more than the classic declaration of love to a title from the past. Eastward is one of the brightest examples of what are the true qualities of independent development: a real pearl that deserves to be discovered, perfectly capable of carving out its space in the niche of instant videogame cult. It is certainly one of the most surprising and impactful experiences of recent years, one of those titles capable of pointing the way to those who will come later."

It is a remarkable game that, while retro in ambition, will paradoxically go on to inspire the drive and uniqueness of future projects. It is clever, vibrant, and unapologetically original, and unless some magnificent twist of fate occurs over the next three months, it will undoubtedly go down as one of the best games of the year."

Everything about Eastward just feels immediately magical and nostalgic, and while my gripes with the combat and stretched out dungeon designs never really went away entirely, Sam’s journey is still one I’m glad I went on in the end."

The ease of use and minimal effort required to drop in and execute some skate tricks is a testament to effective game design: if your core mechanic is perfect, you don't need fluff. Hyperparadise has crafted a masterpiece that improves your day in 15-minute increments, allowing players to turn off their brains and shred."
998,49,The Ramp,90,Hey Poor Player,"Aug  5, 2021","Some of the best games come down to a few simple mechanics. A lot of times, all that sets a great shooter apart from a mediocre one is the feel of mowing enemies down. Tons of games tried to play in the same space as Rocket League before it took the world by storm, but it just feels right. The Ramp takes this concept to an extreme and comes out on the other side with a killer bite-sized experience."

It's designed from the ground up to entertain its players with a simple gameplay loop that can be enjoyed for a couple minutes or a couple hours. That simplicity not only makes it easy to pop in and out of, but its mechanics are incredibly addicting, and setting personal challenges becomes most of the fun. Given its low price and the hours of fun it provides, The Ramp is absolutely worth picking up and dropping into whenever one gets the urge to shred."
1001,49,The Ramp,80,TheSixthAxis,"Aug  9, 2021","The Ramp is a minimal skateboarding experience that acts as more of a tool than a video game.

As if it were a toy model, Hyperparadise seeks to transmit the pleasure of skateboarding in a simple video game with no achievements or objectives, just enjoy the ride, so that the flow of this sport runs through your veins. And it succeeds. First, because it feels like a videogame thanks to its polished mechanics. Secondly, because of the good taste in its art direction and the good design. It's a pity that there aren't more, that this haven of tranquility doesn't hold even more surprises. In the meantime, one of those that we will never tire of recommending."
1004,49,The Ramp,70,Shacknews,"Aug  4, 2021","I’m not going to blast The Ramp too much for how limited it is in its offerings because the developer is pretty straightforward about exactly that. It’s essentially a chill experience without goals or milestones to achieve. You skate to your heart’s content, enjoy the soundtrack, land tricks, crash and burn, and restart to your heart’s content. I enjoyed it for what it is. It’s not something I can imagine anyone putting hours of playtime into. Still, at the very least, if you want to kill some time, stick some tricks, and occasionally absolutely annihilate your poor little skater on some bad landings, The Ramp could be worth a spin at its low price of $6."

The story-focused approach here is interesting, even compelling at parts, but the game doesn't do enough to keep you on track or from getting lost in the many enclosed caves, caverns and tunnels running throughout. Also, like the original, this does have its fair share of bugs and issues. Still, no matter the issues, it is still a genuinely good game.

If you are a fan of the previous title or survival games in general, this really ticks all the boxes that you are looking for, providing an enthralling world to explore and get lost in, all with gorgeous graphics and sound design. It can at times feel like a retread of the previous game with a few tweaks and additions, but Subnautica was by no means a bad game, so this is still a very well-crafted follow-up in the series. It is a hard title to put down as you are always on the cusp of something new and evolutionary, so players in search of something more fast-paced will need to search elsewhere. In saying that, I still think this is a title that everyone should check out or at least give a go, as it really does represent something unique and captivating that is hard to not recommend."

I also did not enjoy the spooky area as it forces a different playstyle of focusing on how far you can go before you reset. I no longer felt like an intrepid explorer and more like a speedrunner, hoping I could key up a sequence, sneak by, and just get ten feet further than I did last time. In the end, the story changes, and parts of the new area are a delight to see. Some of the new mechanics like the rafting or manipulation of light are most welcome. So while Echoes gives up parts of what made Outer Wilds so great in the grand exploration, Echoes of the Eye is a solid companion piece to the base game. I just wish I didn’t spend nearly all of it away from my spaceship."

It's a feat that shows the depth of design prowess Mobius Digital first flexed in its debut title, but stumbles slightly when it tries to redefine its means of progression in the final third. These are the weakest moments in all Outer Wilds, but they aren't enough to sully what this fantastic expansion adds to an adventure that still stands as captivating and engrossing."

It's simple, the first few hours of the adventure are absolutely thrilling, when the player slowly takes ownership of the workings and secrets of an environment that seems to be there from the start. An excellent start, however, a little spoiled by new horror-oriented phases, where you will pace in the dark if you do not have the right information, at the risk of being spotted by frightening creatures and having to go back and forth. frustrating returns to try your luck again.

1046,52,Archvale,70,RPG Fan,"Jan  3, 2022","Archvale’s big claim to fame is the meshing of RPG (items/loot) and bullet hell mechanics. Aside from that, this is an average title at best. We had fun with this one, but probably only because it is cooperative. As a single-player experience, I’m not sure I would have enjoyed it as much. With little substance in the writing, awkward design decisions (crafting is largely pointless aside from armor and weapon drops are rarely tempting), and a cache of bugs, I would only recommend this title to bullet hell enthusiasts or those hungry for a decent cooperative jaunt."

As it stands, Archvale poses some entertaining distractions for compulsive bullet-dodgers, but it could have been so much more."

Because of this, Final Fantasy V has a unique spirit amongst the other Super Famicom/SNES titles. VI does have some elements of customisation, and IV has its moments of silliness, but the core of V is to embrace the fun and experimentation and lose yourself in the adventure. Sometimes, I forget to do that when I’m playing a video game, particularly a Final Fantasy game. So, for that alone, I’m glad I gave the Pixel Remaster of Final Fantasy V a chance."

If you like the twisted style or the sound of the aberrant mythology, you should try this one. It’s going to satisfy on both counts. The only thing that I’m not particularly fond of is that a run can easily take over two hours, just like Fights in Tight Spaces. It’s a large time investment. There’s no quick ‘jumping in’. There’s also a glaring lack of theme between the different locations you’ll be traversing through, which is a little disappointing from an aesthetics point of view. Still, nothing is going to keep me from saving every last salvageable character, from pulling a ‘W’ with every deck, and from getting to the bottom of the meta-story and (hopefully) beating death at his own game. Now if only I could get my hands on a copy of Fall of Avalon, too…"
1063,54,Tainted Grail: Conquest,90,TheSixthAxis,"Jun  2, 2021","Any game so good that you can't resist doing just one more battle in is a game well worth paying attention to, and Tainted Grail definitely manages that."
1064,54,Tainted Grail: Conquest,90,But Why Tho?,"May 31, 2021","Tainted Grail: Conquest is definitely not a title for everyone. Its difficulty and dark atmosphere will undoubtedly be too much for many players out there, even some fans of RPGs, deck-builders, or roguelike. However, for fans that do want those aspects, it’s one of the best in the genre. There are countless hours for players to find in the game, and the deep mechanics and systems are incredibly rewarding"
1065,54,Tainted Grail: Conquest,85,CD-Action,"Jul 23, 2021","A fascinating, fresh take on the Arthurian legend. I wish the lore was more elaborate and the interface less minimalistic, but apart from that it’s an addictive, highly replayable dark fantasy rougelike with fast battles, varied character classes, numerous secrets to uncover, and great music. [08/2021, p.52]"
1066,54,Tainted Grail: Conquest,85,The Indie Game Website,"Jun  1, 2021",It’s a grueling but exhilarating journey that confronts what we probably know all along: that the pain of living through countless deaths and tragedies is ultimately what binds us together in life.
1067,54,Tainted Grail: Conquest,80,RPGamer,"Jul  8, 2021","There’s a lot of things in Tainted Grail: Conquest that show the developers knew what they were doing. It is rare to see a game so fully embrace the type of game it wants to be, as the roguelite nature symbolizes the growth of the protagonist to fully understand their surroundings. The game has a forgiving nature as it does not punish players for dying too often and in turn makes it accessible to pick up and play. All the tinkering options with classes and deckbuilding make it daunting at first glance, but after getting the hang of it, each playthrough feels unique even when using the same class. The realm of Arthurian legend has never quite been explored this way before, and seeing the psychological wear and tear on the denizens of this trapped world is addicting.  Get ready to dive into the Wyrdness, just make sure to have enough Wyrdcandle ready to light the way."
1068,54,Tainted Grail: Conquest,80,Game Rant,"Jun 29, 2021","All in all, Tainted Grail: Conquest is a great experience with a mysterious narrative, a gripping grimdark setting, and enjoyable deckbuilding rogue-lite mechanics. At times certain minor bugs or lighting issues can hold it back, but these things are trivial compared to the great fun players will have. With some future updates to address these minor issues, Tainted Grail: Conquest is shaping up to be a great entry within this subgenre of games."
1069,54,Tainted Grail: Conquest,75,RPG Fan,"Jul 23, 2021","All in all, this title is an uneven experience. The story is more substantial than most roguelites but is hampered by the randomly determined pacing. A few classes are a blast to play, while others feel too weak at high difficulties without good luck. For the first 20 hours or so, you are regularly getting new story content and new upgrades, and it’s easy to sink hours into Tainted Grail: Conquest. I just wish it kept up the pace all the way to the end of the story."
1070,54,Tainted Grail: Conquest,75,PC Invasion,"May 27, 2021","With some major balancing issues that made a majority of its classes unenjoyable, Tainted Grail: Conquest redeemed itself by showing that when the game was balanced, it could be a fantastic experience."
1071,54,Tainted Grail: Conquest,68,COGconnected,"May 28, 2021","So often developers create a game using the kitchen-sink approach and it isn’t always clear how or why disparate mechanics deserve to play together. In the case of Tainted Grail: Conquest, deckbuilding, roguelike progression, and action RPG-type exploration feel compatible with each other as well as the dark fantasy setting and story. Less successful are the punishing, protracted battles that take too long and lack variety over multiple runs. With some additional balancing, classes, card types, and adjustment to pacing, Tainted Grail’s fundamentally solid concepts could shine through the darkness a little better."
1072,55,Quake Remastered,90,Cubed3,"Sep  3, 2021","Quake Remastered is as good as a remaster can be. Not in the sense of the visual enhancements it has made, which, while fine and all, are just the tip of the iceberg. What makes this an excellent repackaging, is the content at hand, due to the addition of all expansions (+ 1), and the support for lots of fan-made and official mods, with more coming in. Melted the single player experience? Now lose your sense of time with online pvp or co-op fun, as well as Crossplay between all modern systems, including the humble Switch. This edition of the FPS classic is also super cheap, and is available for free for those who have already purchased the original. Nightdive Studios has given you plenty of reasons to start fragging and gibbing. You ought to thank them."
1073,55,Quake Remastered,90,Destructoid,"Aug 27, 2021","My first actual full playthrough of Quake was a pretty enjoyable experience. Not only is the port a solid effort, even going above-and-beyond of what’s expected, but it’s also still a great game. Maybe not Doom great, maybe not even Duke Nukem 3D great, but there’s room in this world for all sorts of flavors of ‘90s shooter."
1074,55,Quake Remastered,80,CD-Action,"Nov 15, 2021","It’s not the triumphant return the series deserves, but this classic holds its own surprisingly well. 25 years later it’s still wicked fun and will surely delight nostalgic veterans, especially that the package includes four expansions, one of which is brand new and damn impressive.

1076,55,Quake Remastered,80,PC Games,"Sep 27, 2021","Quake Remastered does the cult classic justice by offering the player not only the base game and all it's add-ons but also two bonus episodes, one of which is brand new. Coupled with 4K graphics, a slick menu and some nice extras it's a great package for fans. You can't deny it's age though - this is still a 25-year-old shooter."
1077,55,Quake Remastered,80,Everyeye.it,"Aug 31, 2021","For those who have never played Quake, the remastered is an unmissable opportunity to fill this gap and to appreciate one of the first person shooters that marked an era. Carmack and Romero with their desire to innovate (and their quarrels!) Have brought the video game industry to a new dimension: Quake is the game that has marked - indelibly - the history of id Software. After the ""earthquake"", in fact, nothing was the same as before. Waiting for a well-deserved reboot / remake, let's console ourselves with this version that offers new content to try and the ability to relive - with a few tears - the frenzy and magic of the old and beloved first person shooters."
1078,55,Quake Remastered,64,Hooked Gamers,"Sep 14, 2021","Quake is pretty much unchanged apart from the fact that the game can now be played on something other than a 640x480 resolution. Yes, it still looks and plays largely the same as the original but is there anything wrong with that. The game played well when it first came out, and that has barely changed at all. Does it still hold up against modern shooters such as Doom Eternal or Borderlands? Probably not. It does feel quite basic, in both the gameplay and in the audio-visual experience. But if you want to relive some fond memories of taking down the monsters from the crypt, then Quake Enhanced will hit the mark."

1082,56,Circuit Superstars,80,Gameblog.fr,"Nov  1, 2021","Circuit Superstars rides the nostalgia vibe of Micromachines N64, but manages to improve the recipe by using gorgeous visuals and adding a pretty realistic physics model into the mix.

1083,56,Circuit Superstars,80,Noisy Pixel,"Oct 18, 2021","Circuit Superstars is a fun and charming arcade racer with depth that is both surprising and rewarding. It fuses retro racing design with modern gaming sensibilities to provide a driving experience you can’t help but want to keep coming back to. With a variety of cars, tracks, and all the essential gameplay modes, this is one of those games you’re going to enjoy jumping into and find yourself wanting to improve your driving skills."
1084,56,Circuit Superstars,75,Worth Playing,"Nov  5, 2021","Circuit Superstars has a few things that won't sit well with players. The inability to come back after making one mistake can be deflating, especially when it is a result of online play not reacting well to the physics system. Unlockables are limited to cosmetics, so that may dampen the desire for progression, while the inability to save midway through longer circuits discourages those who are short on time. The game remains fun enough that you'll want to master the sensitive handling of each vehicle, and the number of tracks and cars is pretty good for the price. If you're the patient type who has a bunch of likeminded friends who want a challenging racing title, this is worth a shot."
1085,56,Circuit Superstars,70,Hardcore Gamer,"Oct 22, 2021","If you do any type of eSports racing or are a long time fan of racing in general, Circuit Superstars is worth a look. If you enjoyed the classic games of racing’s past such as RC Pro Am and the like, then this will be right up your alley. While the Grand Prix is fine for single player, it’s going to take devoted effort to learn the game and the tracks. It lacks the hook and appeal of Mario Kart, which makes Circuit Superstars less inviting to spend hours on learning everything. This is a fun racing game to play with friends with the same light-hearted approach the developers had when creating the game. For $19.99, this is a great good option to have in your arsenal when friends come over."

Not once did I have a technical issue aside from one that I assume was related to Steam, it was a joy to play from start to finish and is the version this review is based on."

1101,57,Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin,80,RPG Site,"Jul  7, 2021","I greatly enjoyed my time with Monster Hunter Stories 2, but if this review reads more restrained than the score might make you feel - it's because as much as I enjoyed the game, it still has its fair share of flaws, and I'm unsure if players with less of a history with the franchise might be willing to overlook them. Your mileage may vary, but one thing's for sure - it's great to see that Monster Hunter: Stories isn't dead, and hopefully this is just one of many more sequels to come."

1105,57,Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin,80,MGG,"Jul  7, 2021","Far from being a childish little game, Monster Hunter Stories 2 is an excellent spin-off that skillfully takes the universe and the mechanics of the license before adapting them brilliantly in a very different genre. The story is easy to follow, the art direction is not lacking in charm, and the fights are satisfying. Exploring the world in order to get your hands on all the possible monsters, then tinkering with their genes in order to make a great team is very satisfying, even if there are some clumsinesses in the interface and it can be a bit repetitive. We highly recommend it, both to Monster Hunter fans and to those who are looking for an alternative to Pokémon."

Barren locations and unappealing textures do kick things down a notch when exploring its world, but you’ll forget about them as soon as you enter combat and bask upon the detailed, epic monster models and their special attack animations. It’s not perfect, but underestimating Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin would be a disservice to fans and newbies alike, as it’s a fully-fledged turn-based RPG that also has a lot of the mainline entries’ DNA baked into it."
1108,58,Loop Hero,98,Hooked Gamers,"Mar 17, 2021","There is much more to praise this game for: the complexity of it’s deckbuilding and tile placements and how these can be a test of knowledge to maximise their potential; the superb blend of gameplay mechanics intertwined with the theme of entropy and destruction as well as the open-design methodology towards accessibility with a series of optional aids. But to talk about these more would be a disservice to the rewarding experience of discovering these mechanics for yourself, so here’s where I’ll leave it...I can think of no higher praise than to admit that even as I write this review, I have Loop Hero playing in the background. My adventurer, step by step, ticking away at his sisyphean struggle to restore the world."

1110,58,Loop Hero,95,Malditos Nerds,"Mar  9, 2021","There are many reasons why Loop Hero is an amazing game, such as the combination of different mechanics from different genres, setting up the road and your camp as if it were a strategy game, building our hero as if it were an RPG and the story, very similar in storytelling to graphic adventures of yesteryear. All of this makes a combo that everyone should enjoy."
1111,58,Loop Hero,91,Ragequit.gr,"Mar 26, 2021","Under the roguelite hood, Loop Hero serves as a perfect analogy of an everyday person's daily routine: wake up, face the obstacles, reach your (almost unattainable) goal, set a new goal, measure your losses.

1114,58,Loop Hero,90,The Games Machine,"Mar 16, 2021","Behind the appearance of an idle game with a weird palette lies a deeply strategic title, which requires a careful management of resources and the ability to foresee the moves of our hero in advance. Its simplicity makes it a game for everyone, while its complexity will make it a real challenge for veteran adventurers and RPG players. The camp management, the gathering of materials, the weapons and enemies statistics, the unlockable classes and the combinations of memory cards make Loop Hero one of the best strategy games of recent times."
1115,58,Loop Hero,90,Twinfinite,"Mar 12, 2021","Loop Hero is yet another stunning gem that fans of the rogue-lite genre will enjoy. It’s a blend of so many different types of games that it becomes a completely unique entity on its own, and it’s hard to think of anything else that offers an experience quite like this one. It’s a game that forces you to trust in your own decisions, commit to them, and either reap the rewards or face the consequences. There’s no control, and that’s the beauty of this game."
1116,58,Loop Hero,90,Shindig,"Mar 10, 2021","Loop Hero is something truly unique: you could fairly describe it as a sort of reverse tower defence roguelike deck-building strategy RPG, but that doesn’t really do it justice. It’s a game that takes all those pieces and combines them into something that isn’t quite like anything else out there. Sharp writing and a story that moves effortlessly between morbid humour and murky existentialist musing tie it all together nicely, but its in the fascinating experience of exploring the little details of its web of intertwined systems that Loop Hero finds its true brilliance."

1121,58,Loop Hero,90,Softpedia,"Mar  4, 2021","The developers have nailed the sense of progression and the tension that the genre is built around. The presentation is very old-school, which can be a problem for players who have never interacted with MS-DOS titles. It is also integral to the spirit of this game. Loop Hero is a great game for fans of its genre and has plenty of cool mechanics and hooks for those who want to try it out for the first time."
1122,58,Loop Hero,90,Hardcore Gamer,"Mar  4, 2021","Loop Hero is a brilliant piece of work that plays and succeeds with the idea of repeating gameplay loops via gameplay, story and even meta angles. It’s an absolute beast that will easily rip players to shreds, but thanks to simple gameplay that makes great use of deck-building, automatic battles and experimentation, it ensures that everyone will have a blast trying to design the best world possible for each run. Throw in a gorgeous presentation that perfectly channels classic early-era RPGs and you easily have what could wind up being one of the year’s best games. A fresh twist on roguelikes, it truly is a loop that you’ll gladly want to explore again and again and again and again…"

Giving players agency on the adversaries they encounter, and the frequency of said encounters, is an exciting spin on the genre, and one that forced me to strategize in a unique way. Couple the outstanding mechanics with a gorgeous and well-executed visual design, and you’ve got yourself one satisfying gameplay loop."

Don’t let the idle aspects of the game fool you, though. There’s a surprising amount of depth and strategy to the game that goes well beyond what you’d expect from it. Loop Hero is the kind of game that will have you telling yourself that you’ll play “just one more loop” while the clock hands make a surprising number of circuits of their own."

It turned out to be a wonderful little treat. The story and art style are solid and the music is fair, but the meat really lies in the gameplay. The world-building allows you to personalize it, but also to develop your own strategy. It becomes addicting and enticing to anyone. Even someone like me who struggles with in-game strategy began to just stop, think, and develop the plan for a long game even in the first run of a loop. These mechanics are really what help bring the game to a higher level and pull it up than just a normal 16-bit Adventure/RPG game. While a simple concept on the face, Loop Hero has mountains more depth behind it."

It is able to tell a story with more heart and depth than usually possible through this specific aesthetic. With a soundtrack that sounds like it came out of a lost Nintendo cartridge, following Shadow's journey is a thrilling ride with edge-of-your-seat combat hiding behind every corner. The game's difficulty may turn players away, but that has always been the case with older games such as Castlevania or Master Blaster. You may perish a lot, but the game is so good, you're going to want to keep trying to see how it all plays out."
1170,59,Cyber Shadow,90,Noisy Pixel,"Jan 25, 2021","Cyber Shadow is a beautifully crafted retro action experience complete with formidable enemies and crushing precision platforming. Abilities like the bullet deflect and dash strike provides the classic ninja experience without overloading on reused mechanics. On top of that, the length and replayability options give players a healthy serving of content tosing more time into refining their skills. If you are up for a humblingly difficult but intensely fun 2D side scroller Cyber Shadow just maybe the challenge you’re looking for."

1175,59,Cyber Shadow,80,Atomix,"Jan 29, 2021","Just as with Shovel Knight, the other game published by Yacht Club Games, Cyber Shadow is a true homage to classic NES games, in particular to the Ninja Gaiden trilogy. It has all the elements that we remember fondly from those years, such as a retro sound and looks, but it complements them with modern gameplay mechanics. If we take off some of its visual effects and its resolution, I do see myself playing it in a classic 8-bit console. You only need the directional pad and two buttons to play it."

Its soundtrack is amazing, its environments are impressively designed, and its story steadily pulled me along. What holds it back, to some extent, is that it feels like it's made for people who've already played a hundred games just like it. Cyber Shadow is a product made for fans of an incredibly specific sort of gaming experience, and effectively no one else."

The feeling of becoming more powerful and being able to take down huge enemy threats with your wits and skills is very rewarding, and the levels when you can use your abilities more freely to overcome challenges are quite fun. It's the trial-and-error areas littered with cheap deaths, demanding exact precision over long and frustrating stretches, that hamper the experience.

Doki Doki Literature Club is a horror game first and foremost, and that hasn't changed, but its Plus version feels more steadfast in its messaging, making the game feel almost sadder and more beautiful.

You might not be as surprised as you were during your first playthrough of DDLC! back in 2017 (or whenever you played it), but you will be quite intrigued and puzzled as you try and unlock the additional content. Just do your best to avoid spoilers that will be posted online. If you haven’t played DDLC! before, DDLCP! is worth your time and an excellent way to get into the franchise.

Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! is a delight. It’s horrific. It’s heartbreaking. But most of all, it’s a wonderful model of how to take the visual novel formula and absolutely turn it on its head.

The tables revamped from standard-screen play were already a good pinball time and the two new ones complement them well, plus the move to VR makes any digital pinball better.  Standard flat-screen digital pinball is always a compromise of viewpoints, trying to find the least-unsatisfying angle, but VR pinball is as close as possible to playing the real thing.  Being able to track the ball with your eyes and focus on a section of the table, or lean forward or around to get a better view of an otherwise-obstructed shot, just makes it so much more playable than it would be otherwise.

It rewards exploration and finds new ways to challenges players at every turn, and some of its unique mechanics stand shoulder to shoulder with other titans of any of its influences."
1210,62,GRIME,90,IGN,"Aug  9, 2021","Grime is an exceptional Souls-inspired take on the 2D Metroidvania. An intricate, stone-carved world full of mysteries provides a sure-footed foundation for deep, finely-balanced combat and breathless, devious platforming. Best of all, it's a Souls-like that forgoes punishment in favour of encouragement, happy to lend a helping hand whenever you fall."
1211,62,GRIME,90,GamingTrend,"Aug  2, 2021","Grime is an expertly crafted 2D action-adventure game that combines satisfying combat, tight platforming, and rewarding progression to earn its place as one of the most enjoyable titles I’ve played this year. It’s also got some brutally tough, memorable bosses that will truly test everything you’ve got. If you’re a fan of a challenge and aren’t too fussed about a story, you’ll have an incredible time with Grime."
1212,62,GRIME,89,Ragequit.gr,"Aug 29, 2021","Visual surrealism, difficult handling, vague and abstract lore. Grime is a title that every metroidvania fan should consider. Brutal and gorgeous, it gives the impression of a diamond in the rough that captivates you with all the perspectives that unfold before its carving. For us it's already the metroidvania of the year."
1213,62,GRIME,85,PC Invasion,"Aug  5, 2021","Grime is a stellar offering that stands ahead of the pack in both the Souls-like and Metroidvania subgenres. Its challenging combat and platforming mechanics add unique quirks that make for a refreshing experience. It does have a few notable flaws, but you'll have a great time in its bizarre world."
1214,62,GRIME,85,Vgames,"Aug  3, 2021","GRIME Isn't just exciting because it's a game made in my home country - it's exciting because it's simply a very good game. It manages to be hard and challenging without frustrating the player too much and it's level design and combat is good, albeit a bit hampered by technical issues."
1215,62,GRIME,82,COGconnected,"Aug  3, 2021","Ultimately, Grime is an overall successful transposition of the 2D Soulslike subgenre into a new and engaging world. Although it lacks the emotional richness of the best Souls games, Grime’s striking environments, solid combat, imaginative enemies and original mechanics all work together in harmony, and it clearly establishes a formula that is open to refinement and possibility."
1216,62,GRIME,80,Finger Guns,"Sep 20, 2021","GRIME brings nothing new to the Metroidvania tag, but it doesn’t have to. Challenging enough combat, with some RPG-like loadout elements make for engaging gameplay. That it’s gross and its bosses skin-crawling also work in its favour. If you enjoy your challenging platformers, you’ll enjoy this."

1219,62,GRIME,80,GameSpace,"Aug 20, 2021","Grime is, much like its central character, an odd amalgamation of ideas, from Souls based RPGs, to platforming punch em ups, all oddly twisted into something that looks like a little nightmare all its own. If you’re looking for something different but utterly beautiful, then Grime is worth your time."
1220,62,GRIME,80,TheSixthAxis,"Aug 11, 2021","Grime is a superb indie gem that will delight fans of challenging games. While its design is influenced by Metroidvanias, the difficulty and mentality are straight from From Software’s book. There's some issues that are being worked on by the developers, but the combat is so good here that backtracking through areas rarely feels like a chore. In short, Grime is an essential purchase for anybody seeking a real challenge."
1221,62,GRIME,80,Hardcore Gamer,"Aug 10, 2021","The depths and caverns of Grime are home to terrible creatures, weird residents, gorgeous scenery and a huge amount of secrets to chase after, and once you get a hang of it, it’s almost impossible to stop until you’ve fought and explored through every inch of its twisted world."
1222,62,GRIME,80,Multiplayer.it,"Aug  9, 2021","A solid metroidvania that implements many elements from the souls series in a smart and interesting system. It's unique art style and inspired world greatly add to the overall quality, making it a valid choice for anyone who loves the genre."

1224,62,GRIME,80,Checkpoint Gaming,"Aug  5, 2021","GRIME dishes up an intriguing universe with even more intriguing enemies and bosses. While its story is on the shallow side, its original visuals and combat mechanics steal the show. However, be warned: in true souls-like fashion, GRIME’s combat is brutal and unforgiving, which might not make it a game for everyone. That said, if you’re not afraid of jumping straight into the action, the game will be just as rewarding as it is challenging. If you thrive on skill-based gameplay and enjoy titles like Dark Souls and Hades, GRIME is sure to be a good fit for your library."
1225,62,GRIME,80,Shacknews,"Aug  3, 2021","Grime does a great deal of things in metroidvania and soulsborne gameplay quite well. It’s got an engaging combat system full of customization and fun weapons. Additionally, the ability to absorb enemies for unique abilities is a really great way to individualize your playstyle. It’s also got some incredible environments to explore chockfull of unique enemies and platforming to overcome. I really wish it had a better handle on fast-travel because of how tough and frustrating it can be. That aside, Grime is an invigorating, fun, and challenging journey with a rather outlandish story and a great handle on action-RPG platforming and combat."
1226,62,GRIME,78,SpazioGames,"Aug 19, 2021","GRIME is a game that knows how to balance metroidvania and soulslike game mechanics. While the cryptic story unfolds, the game becomes harder in the second half, showing a bit of imbalance."

1228,62,GRIME,75,Noisy Pixel,"Aug  2, 2021","Grime is a Souls-like experience that’ll cleanse your pallet between the more significant releases of the genre. It mainly acts as filler, but it also keeps your reactions to tense action gameplay in top shape for whatever you’ll play next. The atmosphere really sells the dreary adventure with the help of an excellent artistic design, a stellar soundtrack, and engaging combative mechanics. Still, there’s a noticeable lack of boss spectacle and challenge required to at least cause a few fist clenches."
1229,62,GRIME,70,Hey Poor Player,"Oct  1, 2021","There’s no arguing that GRIME is one of the most breathtakingly beautiful Metroidvanias ever created, and it’s obvious that a lot of love was put into it. Unfortunately, the attempt to create some kind of compromise between Dark Souls and Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow created a product that, while still undoubtedly fun, felt a little too lukewarm at times to truly be considered “great.” I think that if certain things got revamped, GRIME could be a totally killer Metroidvania. But, until then, it’ll just be “good.”"

Unfortunately, Grime wears that on its shoulder with pride, instead of doing anything remotely interesting. In essence, it’s the software equivalent of saying ‘only fans of the soulikes genre will enjoy this’."
1232,62,GRIME,55,GameCritics,"Sep 10, 2021","Grime is a game of gaping contradictions. It is one of the most visually striking releases of the year… and also one of the ugliest. It’s one of the most imaginative games in some time… and also one of the most generic. For all of Grime’s talk about chiseled stone, the experience feels like a half-finished sculpture – occasional details reveal tantalizing glimpses of the creators’ vision, but it’s largely an indistinct blob."

1236,63,Life is Strange: True Colors,90,Digital Spy,"Oct 22, 2021","True Colors makes an extremely strong case for the best Life Is Strange game yet, with an affecting story that tackles themes such as loss and belonging and featuring the series' most likeable protagonist to date in Alex Chen. The town of Haven Springs is also a standout, and by the end of the game, I was sad that I had to say goodbye to the cast of characters. Hopefully this isn't the last time we see Alex."

Even if it is not free of flaws (repetitions, invisible walls, long loading times...), it knows how to create the right atmosphere by relying on melancholic music and good acting. Its concept of auras works perfectly and allows for some very nice sequences. With its neat graphics, its excellent voice acting and its endearing characters, it is a great Life is Strange."

1247,63,Life is Strange: True Colors,80,GamesBeat,"Oct 15, 2021","While Alex’s story didn’t have the most action in it, it was full of emotion and it was a story worth telling. I give this one five stars out of five when it comes to its narrative, but I drop it down a notch to four stars out of five because of the clunky movement and too-familiar gameplay. I’m looking forward to what Dontnod and Deck Nine can do with next-generation platforms and the future Unreal Engine. But for now, they fell just a little short of what I was hoping for."

It doesn't really break any rules or do anything shocking, but it's a comfortable game to play. The time I spent in Haven Springs put me in a shockingly good mood for a game revolving around a murder, and I welcomed the entire experience. Unfortunately, the tacked-on murder mystery drags down the story somewhat and keeps it from reaching the highest highs that it can. If you're a fan of the franchise, you're sure to like this latest entry."
1249,63,Life is Strange: True Colors,80,VG247,"Sep  8, 2021","Of the Life is Strange games I've completed (2 is still woefully unfinished for me atm), True Colors is my favorite. It strikes the perfect balance of focus on Alex as a person, the town of Haven Springs as a community, and how the two interact and change each other. While I'm still not sold on the superpowers as a mechanic or narrative device, they're unobtrusive enough to be fine, and do provide more to actually do besides walking around, looking at things and talking to people. If you liked previous entries in the Life is Strange series, you'll probably enjoy this one. It's a tighter, cleaner take on the formula, but at its heart, it's still the balance of magic and mundane that’s become signature to these games."
1250,63,Life is Strange: True Colors,80,Windows Central,"Sep  8, 2021","Life is Strange: True Colors struggles to justify some of its earlier chapters, but makes up for it with strong characters and a fun LARP session to mix up the gameplay.

Unfortunately, the gameplay is quite boring and we encountered some technical problems."
1256,63,Life is Strange: True Colors,70,GameSpot,"Sep  9, 2021","There is light that developer Deck Nine just never allows darkness to touch, and there is joy to be had in being able to play some small part in making sure they all do better. But the disconnect between that vibe and the turmoil that brought Alex here to begin with is tangible, and the game would achieve brilliance if those two concerns could connect. Dropping by Haven Springs is still time well-spent--but it's simply a pleasant visit, rather than a powerful, emotionally resonant one."

With this episode, Deck Nine Games chose to explore empathy from top to bottom; a preponderant aspect in the powers granted, the narration and the construction of the characters. The whole provides a very neat adventure on a human level, but which undeniably lacks a certain liveliness in its actions and the unfolding of the plot. The result is an investigation that lacks a certain panache."

The animals are fun to care for and not too troublesome. Befriending wild animals such as birds and rabbits prove rewarding and worth the effort. Henford-on-Bagley beautifully captures the rural British lifestyle, completing the immersive living-in-the-countryside feel. The errands system is also good fun and rewarding, but is sadly only limited to Henford-on-Bagley and to certain residents. The competitions felt a little lackluster, as well as the collection of new objects for furnishing homes. Apart from this, Cottage Living is a great new addition to The Sims 4.

There’s currently nothing to anchor it in memory but there’s so much space to play with. I am begging to see more for this one, I just hope it’s not too little too late."

1287,65,Boomerang X,80,TheSixthAxis,"Jul 13, 2021","Boomerang X is the 2AM food truck run of arena shooters. You're in and out before you know it, but holy shit is it amazing. The boomerang abilities that form the core of the gameplay are unique and insanely addicting, but there's always new foes and features constantly revealing themselves as the game progresses. It's a brief experience, maybe too brief, but it's still an unforgettable one."
1288,65,Boomerang X,80,Shacknews,"Jul  8, 2021","Boomerang X is a fresh take on the arena shooter. Focusing on one weapon, the range in abilities and the ceiling for skill make frenetic combat exciting in just about every instance. The game is rather short, but that works perfectly for the pace of both the story and combat. Only feeling dull in the moments between the action, DANG! and Devolver Digital have an impressive indie on their hands with Boomerang X."
1289,65,Boomerang X,80,Hey Poor Player,"Jul  8, 2021","Boomerang X doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it gives an underrated weapon the spotlight it deserves. With tight controls, frantic combat, and plenty of options, I had a fantastic time from beginning to end. I’d love to see what else DANG! can do with a boomerang, but this is an adventure worth taking."
1290,65,Boomerang X,75,Multiplayer.it,"Jul 25, 2021","Boomerang X is a game built on a nice idea, but it needs some replayability to compete with the best arena shooter out there."
1291,65,Boomerang X,75,Jeuxvideo.com,"Jul  9, 2021","With Boomerang X, the DANG studio goes straight to the point and brilliantly exploits a lively and enjoyable gameplay, which allows the most beautiful bloody choreographies."
1292,65,Boomerang X,72,COGconnected,"Jul  9, 2021","To dismiss Boomerang X as little more than a tech demo would be unfair, but it is also hard to ignore that the game skimps on a lot of elements that would give it depth and replayability or really make the player engage with something more than throwing a weapon to kill waves of enemies, no matter how initially satisfying that can be. Not everyone is going to love the attention-getting and specific art style and level of abstraction, or the bare minimum story or lack of interesting characters. That said, a game that knows how to balance its strengths with just enough story, gameplay, and challenge is worth playing, and Boomerang X definitely knows its strength."
1293,65,Boomerang X,70,Hooked Gamers,"Jul 12, 2021","To the game's credit, there is a fair bit of replay value here. The combat itself is complex enough to support multiple playthroughs based on nothing more than the satisfaction of mastering it. There's also a New Game Plus mode to add additional challenges as well as a whole slew of options to tweak the gameplay that would be good for, at the very least, a momentary diversion. However, if the combat doesn't grab you there's not much that additional playthroughs and game modes won't do much to draw you in. So if you're thinking of picking up Boomerang X but are unsure if it's worth the money, do yourself a favor and grab the free demo first. That should be more than enough to decide if the game is for you."
1294,65,Boomerang X,70,Checkpoint Gaming,"Jul 11, 2021","Boomerang X is truly a spiral of interlocking gameplay loops stacked on top of each other. After a slow start, Boomerang X whips up an absolute whirlwind of bullet-time style combat that can be an absolute sight to behold. So much love and care have clearly permeated the gameplay of this title. The problem is that beyond the loop, there isn’t a lot going on. Some frustrating design elements and a feeling of repetition is present, although it doesn’t fully dampen what is undoubtedly some fantastic moment-to-moment gameplay."
1295,65,Boomerang X,70,PC Invasion,"Jul  8, 2021","Fantastic gameplay paired with a game structure that resembles a tech demo makes Boomerang X worthwhile, even if it doesn't live up to its potential."

After the first playthrough, you’re free to refine your skills, but there’s not much to do thereafter. The beautiful environments beg to be explored but offer no reward or discovery, which is a missed opportunity. There’s little denying how fun this game is, but I couldn’t help but want more."

The characters are fun, the lines of dialogue are well-written, the possibilities are all interesting. Veronica manages to be sympathetic despite being all too capable of murder. The replay value of the experience is higher than for any of their previous titles. This means that even for newcomers to the genre this is a great title to take a chance on."
1299,66,Overboard!,85,Critical Hit,"Jun 15, 2021","With a wicked sense of humour, loads of visual flair, and a surprising amount of cerebral satisfaction packed into its deceit-filled race against the clock, Overboard! is a delight. It’s one to keep within arm’s reach when you’re in the mood for short bursts of frantic, but low-effort, fun."
1300,66,Overboard!,85,GameCritics,"Jun  3, 2021","Overboard is a brief experience, but the depth of content makes playing it over and over again an absolute must. Everyone on the ship has secrets to ferret out, and the script is so well-written that I found myself resetting the game just to see how obviously terrible choices would play out. Overboard asks for a tiny time commitment, but it’s such a charming experience and so easy to zip through that I’d imagine players will find themselves compelled to keep trying until they get away scot-free with the cash."
1301,66,Overboard!,80,NME,"Jun 16, 2021","Overboard! takes a genre much in need of a facelift and perks it right up. It manages to be thoughtful and intricate, whilst also maintaining pace and rhythm. Although it lacks the hidden depths it appears to tease, it’s a well-rounded game and an evening of charming vintage fun."

As you poke and prod at your hapless subjects, the game also intrigues and motivates you to move forward and make choices that matter. Even with its familiar storyline, the game provides fresh perspective with a genuinely challenging game of interrogation and deduction that slowly unravels an engrossing narrative. Silicon Dreams is a compelling experience that fans of the cyberpunk genre will definitely enjoy."
1307,67,Silicon Dreams,85,Softpedia,"Apr 21, 2021","Silicon Dreams has a good main concept and careful, expressive writing. Each scenario offers a dilemma to deal with. The situations are very emotional and the decisions are always challenging. Even after playing through a situation, I found something new to think about or to explore when the game made me return to it. Every fan of “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?” or works influenced by it will find something to love in the tight experience that Clockwork Bird has designed. There is also plenty of space for them to expand both the story and the mechanics in meaningful ways in future titles set in the same universe."
1308,67,Silicon Dreams,80,Finger Guns,"Apr 22, 2021","If you’re a fan of Philip K. Dick’s seminal work, Silicon Dreams is absolutely worth your time. It’s not the most interactive game but it expertly explores some thought provoking themes that are synonymous with Blade Runner via an engrossing game play loop and well crafted dialogue. It’s only 4 hours long but you’ll want to play this game twice."
1309,67,Silicon Dreams,80,TheGamer,"Apr 18, 2021","Silicon Dreams is a tremendous detective game. The way you grill these androids for information is highly engaging. I was surprised many times by the responses I got from my interrogations and the narrative continued to get more and more compelling as I went on. If the idea of delving into the minds of androids to see what makes them tick sounds like a fun time, then you should experience the dystopian nightmare that is Silicon Dreams."
1310,67,Silicon Dreams,75,GameCritics,"Jul  6, 2021","Silicon Dreams asks important questions that address our nature as human beings and the rights of minorities, while also providing its own interesting brand of sci-fi narrative while avoiding shallow slogans and easy resolutions, and it definitely comes recommended for those wanting something more engrossing and relevant than the average visual novel."

Even if you are just a history fan with a passing interest in gaming, I’d still say this is a must buy for the exceptional documentary videos throughout. I’d keep raving about it… but I have to mount my horse and fend off another attack on my castle!"
1316,68,Age of Empires IV,95,AusGamers,"Oct 25, 2021","Age of Empires IV isn’t something strictly for fans, there’s no accrued history you need to know before jumping in. It does however feel like a natural extension of Age of Empires II’s brilliance -- and for that does feel like the return of something great. What you’ve got here is a modern progression of the age-old, well, Age of Empires formula with all of the style and depth you could hope for. As a foundation for more campaigns, more maps, and more of everything to come it’s exciting. The documentary approach to the four campaigns on offer is not only a winner, but a confident step forward for the series. Historical warfare with an eye toward the educational. Age of Empires IV is not only one of the very best slices of real-time strategy gaming, period, it’s a candidate for best game of 2021."

It has everything we wanted, most of the things we hoped for, it is accessible to newcomers and challenging to the veterans. It is built with great attention to detail and obvious passion. If we sift the game through the finest sieve, we will find some issues here and there, mostly in graphical elements and in the slight hesitation of the devs to be innovative. We will do so, though, since we always ask for the best we can have and Relic is the one who can make it happen."

Now, with a similar love for the story, but with a different tone, Age of Empires IV arrives to reposition the franchise in the Olympus of RTS. A title that knows how to pick up and update the essence of the saga, and that is the basis of a resurgence that seems to have a long life ahead of it. If you like the genre, clear your diaries."
1326,68,Age of Empires IV,90,Wccftech,"Oct 25, 2021","Age of Empires IV is, in almost every way, a true sequel to Age of Empires II. It plays great and has a few new features that add more tactical elements to combat and how you develop your faction. On factions, it truly allows them to differentiate themselves from each other. There are slight issues, such as the population cap that feels very restrictive and the lower-quality of unit models, but these are minor in what is an otherwise outstanding game, and one where an undeniable amount of effort and work has gone into - which includes hours of documentary-style clips to support the campaign."

The new documentary cutscene is an excellent attempt, and the fully evolved sound and graphics performance makes the battlefield more immersive."
1329,68,Age of Empires IV,89,Hobby Consolas,"Oct 25, 2021","Age of Empires IV makes a safe bet putting all in on series' classic gameplay, with some new things here and there, but not risking a cent.

1336,68,Age of Empires IV,85,Game Over Online,"Nov 23, 2021","So Age of Empires IV is well put together and polished to high hell. I wish that something new had been done to bring the RTS genre that has been sitting more or less idle for a decade or so into the modern era, but you can’t have everything, and I suspect that more stuff like a map editor will be added in the future. Beyond that, with the recently released AOE2 Definitive Edition, that title, now 22 years old and $30 cheaper, already comes with a map editor that AOE4 lacks, and roughly a trillion player-made maps, and is probably the better bargain for your gaming dollar, especially if somehow you never got around to playing it previously."
1337,68,Age of Empires IV,85,GAMES.CH,"Nov  3, 2021","Age of Empires IV does have it’s rough edges, especially regarding specific control and comfort options.

1338,68,Age of Empires IV,85,LevelUp,"Oct 29, 2021","Age of Empires IV is a solid RTS. It's fun, it's challenging, and it has a promising future.

While it doesn't revolutionize the genre or the license, it does give them an excellent modern representative. The execution is almost flawless, the content is satisfying, the handling is fast, and the gameplay is satisfying. Novices and veterans alike should find something to enjoy, whether playing single or multiplayer. There is even an educational aspect, which helps to renew the interest and the look of battles and wars that we have already followed, or even fought in other games. Apart from a few minor flaws, as is often the case with very good games, we would simply have liked to have more."

It looks great, if not entirely new, and the flow of building, combat, research, and resource management is enjoyable as always. The documentary-style campaigns are engaging and immersive. What holds Age of Empires IV at arm's length from masterpiece status is its determination not to rock the boat, its slightly underwhelming feature set at launch, and some very minor annoyances from previous titles that really should be a thing of the past. Will I be digging deep into Age of Empires IV? Absolutely."
1348,68,Age of Empires IV,83,Game Informer,"Oct 25, 2021","The real-time strategy genre remains relevant, fueled by a few big titles once in a while.

1356,68,Age of Empires IV,80,Game Rant,"Oct 28, 2021","Overall, Age of Empires definitely brings enough to the table and captures enough nostalgia to make it an easy recommendation for any fans of the franchise or the genre. For gamers new to RTS, the Story Mode and campaigns actually make it a very strong choice for diving in as well, as long as they aren’t expecting cutting-edge graphics. The fact that the game is going to be available on Game Pass Day One could potentially help expose a large new audience to the franchise and build up some new fans. It will be very interesting to see what kind of reception it receives and, if its successful, what sort of post-launch content could arrive in the coming year to keep the community hooked and engaged."
1357,68,Age of Empires IV,80,Jeuxvideo.com,"Oct 26, 2021","If it is not free from flaws, Age of Empires IV is nonetheless a very good RTS and a very good episode of the license. By offering more verticality to players and interesting tactical choices brought by civilizations with more marked personalities, Relic Entertainment is bringing back the AoE license in a very nice way. Hopefully the pathfinding and AI concerns raised in this test - and by the players during the beta phases - will be quickly resolved, because it is only there that it will reach its full potential. Still, as it stands, AoE IV is an episode worth seeing, especially for its exciting campaigns."

Considering the constant drought in the genre, the game is probably the best that could have happened for fans at the moment. However we wish the developers would have shown more courage. In the end the game is too similar to Age of Empires 2, it goes the safety route, not risking to do something wrong. And all of that without ever reaching the same atmosphere or charm that made the second entry so great. It is hard to think of reasons why a player who still has a lot of fun with the Definitive Edition of Age 2 should switch to this game. But whoever gets drawn by the small improvements like the new wall system or the gameplay differences between the civilizations can look forward to a great RTS package with many hours of fun."
1359,68,Age of Empires IV,80,Power Unlimited,"Oct 25, 2021","Age of Empires 4 does more than play purely on nostalgia. It's a meticulous follow-up to the original trilogy with a range of options to tailor your RTS experience to your taste. Will it herald the comeback of the genre? No, it's not exceptional, remarkable, or innovative enough for that. It does satisfy the hunger of keyboard-mouse strategists that have been treated too stepmotherly."
1360,68,Age of Empires IV,80,IGN Portugal,"Oct 25, 2021","In short, Age of Empires IV is first and foremost a throwback to the past, for a history lesson that we already know well.

Veterans, on the other hand, have here a new battleground where they will certainly feel at home."

However, we may regret that the game is a bit too academic and without any real risk. But still, Age of Empires IV is a very good game."
1364,68,Age of Empires IV,80,GRYOnline.pl,"Oct 25, 2021","Age of Empires 4 has some technical issues, but they don't change the fact that this is a really good game. The campaign is interesting - I felt that the developers have made AoE4 with respect to its predecessors and still have managed to introduce some changes."
1365,68,Age of Empires IV,80,Stevivor,"Oct 25, 2021","The strategic polish of two decades is on display in Age of Empires 4, both in the history of this series and the pedigree of the developer. Relic has wrapped an interesting if slightly flawed single player experience around what is a superb strategy game. You’ll probably know if you want to play this one, but if you just think medieval warfare is pretty cool and you really like the centuries where England and France just kept invading each other, I recommend you put aside any fears of fast clicking and micromanagement and just jumping in, just avoid that multiplayer menu until you are absolutely ready."
1366,68,Age of Empires IV,80,VGC,"Oct 25, 2021","Newcomers may find it overwhelming, or slightly slow going in the early stages, but the campaign offers a great introduction to the genre, and the building blocks of Age of Empires. Don’t be surprised if you sit down to play a quick game, and then suddenly look at the clock to find that 3 hours have passed, your tea has gone cold, and the army that you’ve been meticulously building has been wiped by a garrison of archers you completely missed."
1367,68,Age of Empires IV,80,VG247,"Oct 25, 2021","Age of Empires 4 is as multifaceted as the events it depicts. It’s more ambitious than other AoE games in handling its content and inspirations, but also far more reserved in changing the fundamentals. There’s no need to change what works already, though a few additional gameplay flourishes could have helped AoE 4 feel more fresh and exciting. The campaigns are robust, but the missing content stands out in its absence. That’s especially true considering Age of Empires 4 is a full-priced release, though being on Game Pass makes it a more appealing prospect. What’s here is still more than enough to be getting on with, but lIke any good strategist, World’s Edge is planning ahead for the long game."

1370,68,Age of Empires IV,80,Eurogamer Italy,"Oct 25, 2021","Age of Empires IV marks the Year 0 of a new era for the saga. Relic and World's Edge used the second chapter as a founding stone to build a new iteration which is half nostalgic and half innovative, shuffling the cards but never too much, creating a game that is appealing for both hardcore fans and complete newcomers. It might have some flaws, but it's really hard to imagine a better fourth episode."
1371,68,Age of Empires IV,80,GameSpew,"Oct 25, 2021","There's a lot to love about Age of Empires IV. It's clear the developers have listened to the community in creating a game that feels both fresh yet faithful to the franchise. It has tried to combine the best elements of all previous games in the series and, largely, it has succeeded in doing so. Its small pool of factions may be a problem for some, and its camera issues need addressing, but in the grand scheme of things, this is an excellent entry into the RTS space. Is Age of Empires IV the best Age of Empires game to date? For me, it doesn't quite knock Age of Empires II Definitive Edition off the top spot, but regardless, this modern entry has undoubtedly been well worth the wait."
1372,68,Age of Empires IV,80,IGN France,"Oct 25, 2021","Age of Empires IV is a brand new, wide open door to the licence. The game adds new layers of epicness, but it strike somewhere between the hardcore fan who might not find everything he likes and the more casual gamer that maybe won't be attracted by its clacissim. It's a great game, just make sure it's for you."
1373,68,Age of Empires IV,80,NME,"Oct 25, 2021","An engrossing tapestry of warfare and scheming throughout the ages, Age Of Empires 4 firmly secures its position as a must-play for strategy fans. Full of sandbox-fuelled drama and interesting campaigns, the game captures the sweeping and costly scale of warfare in a way that few titles manage."
1374,68,Age of Empires IV,80,TheSixthAxis,"Oct 25, 2021","Age of Empires 4 is a deeply enjoyable return for the series. It puts history front and centre, and opts to refresh its gameplay instead of reinvent it. That may not be enough for some. Then again, when you’ve got a series that’s remained the base template for RTS games for more than twenty years, who can blame them?"
1375,68,Age of Empires IV,79,Worth Playing,"Oct 25, 2021","It's that safety in embracing the past that represents Age of Empires 4's most obvious flaw. In many ways, it plays and feels like the game is simply Age of Empires 2 with a very well applied fresh coat of paint. Love letter or no, between the rough issues with the campaign and the reuse of the multiplayer, it feels more like a remaster of an older game than of a new entry into the series. It is not easy to please fans of the long-running franchise while also attempting to attract new ones to it, and Age of Empires 4 finds itself in a strange no-man's land between those two goals."
1376,68,Age of Empires IV,77,New Game Network,"Nov  3, 2021","Age of Empires IV is an old school RTS that should be comfortable for returning players and accessible to newcomers. A bigger focus on historical campaigns is enjoyable, alongside great Skirmish and multiplayer modes."

While some players may blame the lack of risk taking, it must be recognized that disrupting the original gameplay could also have been taken badly. We are therefore dealing with an ""Age of"" classic in substance, but renewed in form."
1379,68,Age of Empires IV,75,XGN,"Nov  8, 2021","Age of Empires 4 is a mixed bag for fans of the franchise. For Age of Empires 2 fans, this is an excellent, true sequel. For fans of Age of Empires 3 however, the gameplay might feel too slow and the diversity in troops is too low. History nuts can enjoy themselves with the campaign, but don't expect a challenge. If you are looking for a classic RTS however, Age of Empires 4 is a fine pick."
1380,68,Age of Empires IV,75,Game Revolution,"Oct 27, 2021","Age of Empires 4 isn’t a bad game at all. I had a lot of fun with it. Its biggest problem is that it plays it too safe. It wants to capture the success of Age of Empires 2 so much that it never really gained an identity of its own. I hope that in the future, the devs take the asymmetrical civilizations further and focus on mechanics that evolve the Age of Empires franchise. There’s a solid foundation here, and if built in the right direction, it could lead to something special. For now, it’s too old school for its own good."
1381,68,Age of Empires IV,75,Press Start Australia,"Oct 26, 2021","Weaving a tried and true gameplay style with a historic documentary twist, Age of Empires IV reminds us not only how great the series once was, but how much better it can be going forward. Bringing back the excitement of real-time strategy, it keeps both the past and the future in mind - and with that, World’s Edge and Relic Entertainment have created an experience that fans of the original games will love, that is also accessible to newcomers of the series as well."
1382,68,Age of Empires IV,75,GameWatcher,"Oct 25, 2021","Age of Empires 4 does a lot well, building from the roots of the AoE franchise. Fans of the original games will find the improved graphics to be welcome and the gameplay to maintain the same fast-paced feel. History buffs will also find themselves delighted by the historical campaigns and the changing art style of the buildings as they progress through the ages. The only real downsides are the ease with which you can lose your rhythm, and the almost mandatory use of hotkeys in multiplayer due to bad pathfinding and unit AI."

But I wouldn’t do so without a few important caveats. Age of Empires 4 may finally be available after 16 years, but it hasn't arrived just yet. There are still resources to gather and troops to assemble."
1385,68,Age of Empires IV,70,GameSpot,"Nov  8, 2021","Age of Empires IV is a satisfying game, but its more innovative ideas are overshadowed by a gameplay formula that rarely deviates from the revered legacy of Age of Empires II. Dated graphics, annoying AI, and a thin selection of content holds Age of Empires IV back from establishing an RTS kingdom that can stand the test of time, but thrilling campaigns, a passion for history, and factions that feel truly distinct from one another makes for satisfying RTS comfort feud."
1386,68,Age of Empires IV,70,Metro GameCentral,"Oct 27, 2021",A highly competent but disappointingly unambitious real-time strategy that fails to move either the genre or the Age Of Empires franchise forward.

Thanks to unique units, buildings and technologies, playing around with each civilisation is fun and offers a different experience each time. Unfortunately, with it feeling so similar to Age of Empires 2 but with many stripped down features, it’s extremely difficult for me to recommend spending £50 on this when you can grab Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition for £15. Maybe it will be better after some updates, but right now it’s just reminding me of better games."
1388,68,Age of Empires IV,70,WellPlayed,"Oct 25, 2021","Age of Empires IV is a worthy return of an iconic series, but is difficult to recommend over older remastered entries.

I have the highest of hopes for the title ⁠— AOE II is, of course, a testament to how strong the series can be ⁠— but Microsoft has a lot of work to do to make Age of Empires IV its own beast."
1391,68,Age of Empires IV,60,Guardian,"Nov 11, 2021","Both longtime RTS fans and Age of Empires vets will find things to love here, a comfy if well-worn tactician’s armchair to slip into, spiffed up, and with a few shining surprises stuffed down the sides.

1393,68,Age of Empires IV,60,Gamer.no,"Oct 25, 2021","Age of Empires IV is fundamentally a true AoE game, but sadly, it's very little else. There are no bold chances taken here, no great additions or revolutionary changes. And that, after so many years, is disappointing."
1394,68,Age of Empires IV,60,Screen Rant,"Oct 25, 2021","While there is nothing especially groundbreaking about Age of Empires 4's formula, it should manage to scratch a very particular nostalgic itch for fans and offer a starting point for beginners to begin their own journey through history."
1395,69,Tails of Iron,90,KeenGamer,"Jan 21, 2022","I have to say, I don't often play games like ToI. I don't mean souls-likes, or RPGs or Indie Games. I mean games that I excitedly yell at people about. Tails of Iron wasn't a transcended experience, it won't revolutionize the gaming industry or anything. It is, however, a well-designed, fun and charming game. It's something I simply need you to experience, and if it can make me feel that way, it deserves some praise."
1396,69,Tails of Iron,90,PC Invasion,"Sep 27, 2021","Tails of Iron could go deeper on the story and lighter on the backtracking, but if it ever gets a sequel I hope it maintains obvious love seen in the art direction and design."
1397,69,Tails of Iron,90,TheGamer,"Sep 17, 2021","From milking bugs to slaying frogs with jetpacks, Tails of Iron is an off-the-walls, brilliantly intuitive sidescroller, but it has a heart and keeps you gripped from start to finish as you slaughter a conveyor belt of would-be challengers. It’s not about avenging your father, not entirely - it’s about family and community. Vin Diesel would be proud. Sadly, it’ll probably get lost in the busy end-of-year shuffle among the triple-A powerhouses. But in the downtime between releases, make some room for Tails of Iron - it’s one of 2021’s best."
1398,69,Tails of Iron,85,CD-Action,"Jan 19, 2022","Superb visuals, distinctive atmosphere and a punishing Dark Souls-inspired combat system resulted in an engaging action RPG and one of the best indie games I played in 2021. [12/2021, p.42]"
1399,69,Tails of Iron,85,COGconnected,"Oct 22, 2021","Thanks to its enchanting art, well written story, heroic rodents and satisfying combat throughout, Tails of Iron stands apart from the seemingly endless wave of Soulslike ARPGs. It modifies the combat formula just enough to make it interesting and couples it with characters that are full of warmth and wit, battling forces that are competent yet fairly matched foes. Not every task and mission is equally interesting and some of Tails’ movement mechanics feel slightly unresponsive, but those are small dings against an otherwise very enjoyable rat-centric game, and we don’t have nearly enough of those."
1400,69,Tails of Iron,82,Multiplayer.it,"Sep 20, 2021","Charming, funny, detailed and a great presentation are key aspects of this little gem. We would have hoped for more things to do, a bigger map and some more quests, but let's stay here until the sequel comes."
1401,69,Tails of Iron,80,Ragequit.gr,"Nov  3, 2021","Although Tails of Iron is made with care, exploration and player freedom could be emphasized much more. Thrilling combat, meagre optional content and some simplified quests strewn over a small gameworld comprise a game of contradictions. We hope it is successful enough so that we can see a more ambitious sequel at some point."
1402,69,Tails of Iron,78,Meristation,"Oct 21, 2021","Tails of Iron offers challenging combat along with some exploration touches with a shy metroidvania personality and some 2D platforming.

All this with an absolutely charming audiovisual presentation."
1403,69,Tails of Iron,77,Everyeye.it,"Sep 17, 2021","The small smudges reported up to this point do not compromise the experience as a whole. In the approximately 10 hours of gameplay required for completion, to which another handful is added to complete all the secondary ones left open, Tails of Iron constantly keeps the player's attention high, just like Redgi's shield. We are far from the complexity of a full-fledged souls-like, but the production of Odd Bug represents an engaging, at times exhilarating challenge, which will certainly keep even the most demanding players busy."
1404,69,Tails of Iron,75,Jeuxvideo.com,"Sep 25, 2021","Even if Tails of Iron has some flaws, starting with its back and forth and its combat system that lacks evolution, the title is simply charming. Helped by its panoply of charismatic characters, its sumptuous visuals and its successful fights requiring precision and coordination, the creation of Odd Bug Studio offers a magnificent journey that we can only recommend ... at least, if the difficulty does not suit you. Don't be afraid."
1405,69,Tails of Iron,70,GameCritics,"Oct  6, 2021","The combat in Tails of Iron excels. The brutal, methodical mechanics never stop being satisfying, but I wish that I felt like I was doing it for more vital reasons.

While the story is lackluster and can even sometimes get in the way of the real joy of actually playing the game, it still adds some degree of depth and direction. Still, the game could do with an option to skip the story all-together and a level selection option after beating it to go back to your favorite planets. Leaving the story aside, flying through the different planets alongside your alien craft is quite an experience on Exo One. Headphones recommended."

Its exploration of the mysterious and deep reaches of space combined with its perfectly arranged soundtrack creates a different kind of sci-fi experience that should definitely be checked out by fans of the genre.

The revamped movement options made traversing the expanded world a treat, though I would’ve liked a fast travel system that didn’t clash with my hoarding instincts. If you like Metroidvanias and Soulslikes and always wanted to know what it would be like if the two genres fused, then Death’s Gambit: Afterlife is for you."

The game takes some getting used to the style of the character as well as the graphics. Destroying enemies after a long struggle, finding a winning strategy, and finding weak points in the game is also a pleasure. It didn't hurt that the game's story was convincingly simple, with some touching moments and a touch of humor. The game took a lot from the Souls series, good or bad, but it's up to you."

It doesn't feel like you're playing Civ, but with some Crusader Kings characters butting in every now and again with some silly tale or grievance. It feels like you're playing Civ, but with some Crusader Kings characters who grow alongside you, whose relationships to you and each other actually matter, and who prove that the great stories of empires aren't about production rates per turn--they're about the people who lived through them.

It adds several new mechanics to an established genre, some of which are clearly brilliant and others that seem less significant. Old World succeeds in giving genre fans a clear alternative to their favorite games, but it seems unconcerned with welcoming the uninitiated, thanks to a fussy interface, lack of patient tutorials, and a focus on a fairly narrow slice of history and culture. Fundamentally, Old World both honors a tradition and gently pushes it forward."

The gameplay, while somewhat reminiscent of those Fire Emblem titles, also provides some key differences that help greatly emphasize the strategy component of the game’s campaign. To SRPG fans looking for another Fire Emblem-esque experience, I’d wholeheartedly recommend giving Dark Deity a chance. It is a truly enjoyable addition to the genre, and one I’m glad I got the chance to further peruse."
1441,73,Dark Deity,90,PCGamesN,"Jul  6, 2021","An outstanding homage to Fire Emblem which, in its rich cast of characters and thoughtful tweaks to combat, occasionally surpasses its classic inspiration."
1442,73,Dark Deity,90,TheSixthAxis,"Jun 24, 2021","Despite being a very blatant homage to Fire Emblem, Dark Deity consistently new layers to both the combat, the strategy, and the characters themselves to keep things feeling fresh. While I don't think the story is quite up to the same standard as its inspiration, I almost prefer the combat here along with the way classes work. Dark Deity is a must-play for fans of strategy RPGs like Fire Emblem, and I'm confident I'll be coming back to it regularly for a long time."
1443,73,Dark Deity,90,Gamer Escape,"Jun 16, 2021","For SRPG fans clamoring for games of a more “classic” style, this title comes highly recommended, especially with the replayability afforded to it through its custom campaign options. I know for sure I’ll be loading this up on the regular for a long time to come."
1444,73,Dark Deity,80,GameCritics,"Aug 11, 2021","Overall, Dark Deity may not have the polish or reach the heights of those classic ’00s Fire Emblem games, but I wouldn’t expect it to — it’s an indie title with a development team of six, but the passion of that team for the genre is apparent throughout the finished product. This is a love letter to classics that’s still accessible enough for those who may want to give the genre a try. And for those of us who miss a TRPG uncluttered by slice-of-life mechanics? It’s a much-welcome addition to the library."
1445,73,Dark Deity,80,Gfinity,"Jun 30, 2021","With an excellent story, tight mechanics, and tons of customization available for players, Dark Deity is a game that any SRPG fan should have in their library. It is unfortunate that outdated and over-sexualized depictions of women slightly tarnish such an otherwise beautiful gem."
1446,73,Dark Deity,80,Noisy Pixel,"Jun 28, 2021","Dark Deity manages to be a competent and entertaining SRPG by offering a decent narrative fueled by the influences of classic entries of the genre. It utilizes systems that fans love while introducing quality-of-life mechanics to provide a seamless and enjoyable experience. There are many familiar elements about this adventure, but it’s one that I found to be approachable and full of charm."
1447,73,Dark Deity,80,Siliconera,"Jun 16, 2021","Dark Deity is a small game that understands its limitations. It delivers thought-provoking battles, if not necessarily the most balanced ones. It gives players a lot of tactical choice, if not in the most informed way. And it cuts clear corners, but it feels like they’re the right corners to cut. Because what’s here is a fun time."
1448,73,Dark Deity,70,Vgames,"Aug 22, 2021","Dark Deity has it's faults, but ultimately it does what it sets to do: Be a wonderful alternative to Fire Emblem on the PC. The devs had their hearts in the right place with this one and it's a great starting point for people who want to tip their toes in the genre."
1449,73,Dark Deity,70,Hey Poor Player,"Jun 30, 2021","I had hoped to give a glowing review of Dark Deity. After all, it does quite a bit right, and manages to streamline many things successfully. Unfortunately, it ultimately was held back by the various poor design choices, glitches, and copious similarities to Fire Emblem. While the latter didn’t bother me, I feel the game could have been a bit more original. That said, this is absolutely a game worth playing for any tactical RPG fan, especially once it’s been patched a bit. Here’s hoping the next game from this upstart team is the polished gem I thought Dark Deity could have been."
1450,73,Dark Deity,70,Screen Rant,"Jun 23, 2021","The game does exactly what it sets out to do, and does so in a competent and engaging way. For fans of Fire Emblem, especially the classic games, Dark Deity has a lot to offer. For new players interested in dipping their toes into strategy roleplaying games, Dark Deity is a good place to start, as long as they are willing to experiment with weapon combos and character placement in the early game."
1451,73,Dark Deity,60,Cubed3,"Aug 23, 2021","Dark Deity is rough around the edges, but has a great structure to its core experience. The sprites look pretty good, and the class changes are one of the highlights to the experience. A weird weapon system, random little problems/glitches and stunted character interaction, all detract from what is fairly solid otherwise. This is the type of strategy game that with a few core patches and overhauls could really become something to look out for."

1453,74,Skul: The Hero Slayer,90,GameSpace,"Feb  5, 2021","This story of a tiny hero is charming and disarming… figuratively and, occasionally, literally. While he is small in stature, Skul proves that sometimes even the smallest among us may achieve the greatest things. Against all odds, Skul may just be the key to fulfilling the dreams of Carleon's First Hero AND the machinations of the Demon King."

1456,74,Skul: The Hero Slayer,87,KeenGamer,"Jan 25, 2021","SouthPAW have done a great job of making a really solid roguelike with interesting mechanics, a surprising amount of depth and a ton of visual charm. The balance still needs a little work and the text could use a little more proof-reading, but with plenty more updates planned well into 2021, this is certainly a game to keep an eye on."
1457,74,Skul: The Hero Slayer,85,COGconnected,"Jan 25, 2021","If I had to compare it to any other title, I would say Dead Cells. Not just because of the similar 2D action platformer gameplay, but also because Dead Cell’s protagonist, the Prisoner, is available as one of the most fun and powerful skulls in the game. So if you’ve been sleeping on Skul: The Hero Slayer while waiting for the development to finish, then it’s high time to walk up and smell the Ents, because this game is one you’ll want to check out."

1459,74,Skul: The Hero Slayer,83,Gaming Age,"Feb  4, 2021","The more time I spend with the title, the more my opinion changes of this game. I started off thinking this game is unnecessarily punishing (A multi-phase boss on the first level…really?) to this it is only hard if I’m not playing methodically. As I got into the upgrade system, the more I find myself hoping the random drops go a certain way (I do enjoy a Skul that can do passive damage or equipping projectile based skulls vs melee based builds). If you want a challenging rogue-like to start 2021, Skul: The Hero Slayer is definitely a viable option, if the Greek Pantheon isn’t your cup of tea."
1460,74,Skul: The Hero Slayer,83,Digital Chumps,"Jan 28, 2021","More than just a competent roguelike fresh out of early access, Skul: The Hero Slayer delivers power-swapping action and a mostly satisfying loop that should sufficiently satisfy your Dead Cells or Hades cravings."
1461,74,Skul: The Hero Slayer,82,The Games Machine,"Feb  5, 2021","Skul: The Hero Slayer has a roguelike concept but it almost feels like a beat 'em up given the amount of enemies we’ll have to face and the amount of characters available, each one with its own personality and moveset. The huge amount of available builds makes each run a unique experience. Fast and fun, with pretty charismatic enemies, colorful and fairly challenging. Absolutely recommended if you love action games with an RPG flavour, and also suitable for hardcore gamers aiming to beat it in as few runs as possible."
1462,74,Skul: The Hero Slayer,82,Multiplayer.it,"Feb  3, 2021","A brilliant roguelite, made really special by its curious class system and amazing variety. It's obviously not the most balanced game out there, but it's still great fun, and full of heart."
1463,74,Skul: The Hero Slayer,82,IGN Italia,"Jan 25, 2021","A great new take in the roguelite world. Skul: The Hero Slayer is a must-have for all roguelite lovers, with so many balanced builds and combinations. Suffers from an high difficulty spike in the first hours and a not so great level design, but it's surely worth a try."
1464,74,Skul: The Hero Slayer,80,GameCritics,"Mar  9, 2021","The horrors of the last year have given me a new appreciation for the type of entertainment that allows me to fall into a predictable routine, and roguelikes are the perfect venue. In the past, too many developers have assumed that the simple inclusion of procedurally-generated levels is enough to keep run-based games interesting, but the increased regularity of quality titles like Skul leaves me confident that studios are learning, and that the roguelike renaissance isn’t going away anytime soon."
1465,74,Skul: The Hero Slayer,80,TheSixthAxis,"Feb  8, 2021","It isn’t without its rough edges, but Skul is a really compelling experience, and definitely scratches the itch left by the button-mashing brawling of Hades and Dead Cells. If you’ve played those games to completion, or if you want a game with decadent pixel art and a wealth of characterful play options, then it’s an easy recommendation - just don’t lose your head during those challenging final stages."
1466,74,Skul: The Hero Slayer,80,The Indie Game Website,"Jan 29, 2021","It’s definitely on the harder end of the roguelike genre, but that only makes it all the more satisfying whenever you succeed.

1467,74,Skul: The Hero Slayer,80,Hey Poor Player,"Jan 27, 2021","Skul: The Hero Slayer is a fun little title whose cute graphics belie the tough challenges and grinds that lie within. Dying is all part of the appeal, and never once is it frustrating or unfair. You’ll want to keep returning again and again in order to get just a little bit further, or to perhaps secure a new type of outfit or skill. It deserves a place on your playlist if you have any sort of affection for old 16-bit RPG-brawlers."
1468,74,Skul: The Hero Slayer,80,IGN,"Jan 26, 2021","Skul: The Hero Slayer is an original take on a well-established genre, using its novel head-swapping mechanic to put a plethora of unique playable characters front and center. Though both its story and boss variety leave something to be desired, the quirky characters and satisfying, fast-paced combat had me eager to bone up on my skeletal skills even after the credits rolled."
1469,74,Skul: The Hero Slayer,80,Noisy Pixel,"Jan 24, 2021","Skul: The Hero Slayer is a great roguelike adventure that ties fast action with a charming narrative. The game understands what makes this genre addicting but doesn’t rely too heavily on influences, which allows it to stand out prominently. If you are hungry for a roguelike, this is a great way to satisfy your cravings."
1470,74,Skul: The Hero Slayer,80,PC Invasion,"Jan 20, 2021","Skul: The Hero Slayer is lovely, action-packed, and full of excellent choices. Repetition can set in rather quickly due to tedious bosses, and a single crash can ruin an entire run, but it's one of the better action rogue-lites I've had the pleasure to dump some time into."
1471,74,Skul: The Hero Slayer,70,DarkStation,"Feb  3, 2021","Skul: The Hero Slayer has a lot going for it, but it is also muddled with design issues. For all of its creative skull designs, interesting build options, and cool and flashy attacks, I found the experience as a whole to be draining. It’s a case where the core gameplay loop is hindered by its overbearing rogue elements. A genre reliant on repetition has to accommodate for it by offsetting the recursive elements of the game, no matter how good the combat is. Skul: The Hero Slayer is certainly enjoyable on occasion, but its roguelite ingredients ultimately harm the title as a whole."
1472,74,Skul: The Hero Slayer,70,Eurogamer Italy,"Jan 20, 2021","While offering nothing truly groundbreaking, Skul: The Hero Slayer is a fun, colorful, and fast-paced rogue-lite, a good baptism of fire for newbies to the genre and a pleasant pastime for those who have consumed their fingertips on titles like The Binding of Isaac and Hades."

League players (and those from other Riot games) get the opportunity to explore worlds they may have heard about, but never visited. For those unfamiliar with League, you get the opportunity to explore a land of pirates in an accessible story-driven RPG and expose yourself to Runeterra’s universe. The story is compelling and beautifully told, and the lands of Bilgewater and Shadow Isles are full of secrets. While it’s great you need not grind, the combat system feels like it was changed for the sake of change.

The move to an open world helps the game stand apart, with added freedom to take the fight to your enemies and a vast arsenal of weapons and vehicles to bring into battle.

Everything feels very natural and familiar, but almost seems interchangeable with previous games. The lack of innovation is something that plagues many first person shooters of this generation, yet Halo Infinite is a more than solid game that is worth your precious time and attention."
1513,76,Halo Infinite,80,PC Games,"Dec  6, 2021","When it comes to combining fluid combat with a gorgeous open world, Halo Infinite is an astounding success. In terms of story, side activities and indoor level design however, this entry leaves much to be desired. The multiplayer is a beast of its own, merging modern design choices with many traditional qualities. Even if you usually don't go for free to play games, this is easily one of the best Halo Multiplayer experiences in a long time."
1514,76,Halo Infinite,80,Hardcore Gamer,"Dec  6, 2021",The longevity of Halo Infinite will rest with its multiplayer battles as this is the online shooter the world has been needing. Halo Infinite is the defining project from 343 Industries thus far.
1515,76,Halo Infinite,80,LevelUp,"Dec  6, 2021","343 Industries went on a mission to retain the hallmarks of the series to deliver the experience fans crave, avoiding controversial mechanics or radical changes. The new that is added feels organic relative to the old. Halo Infinite excels with solid gameplay, although it spreads too thin."
1516,76,Halo Infinite,80,Jeuxvideo.com,"Dec  6, 2021","True, in the collective subconscious, Halo has always been a first person shootout set in large environments. But Infinite finally delivers a vision of what Master Chief can give inside a universe that lives up to its reputation. As well as bearing little in the way of his tumultuous development, the game manages to make John-117 so fun to play that it's hard to let go of the pad once the campaign begins. Whether during confrontation or in the exploration phases, the title of 343 Industries is appealing. However, once the campaign is over, we can only regret the absence of different biomes and the scarcity of truly epic sequences. Elements which have nevertheless been the hallmark of the series for twenty years! In short, we gain in freedom of action what we lose in spectacle. With such successful main mechanics, we would have liked an even more ambitious campaign, period."
1517,76,Halo Infinite,80,MGG,"Dec  6, 2021","The gameplay is more satisfying than ever, the new semi-open world format works like a charm, and yet Halo Infinite fails to make its campaign the unforgettable moment we were expecting. The obvious lack of ambition in the storyline, which feels like a prologue, and too many repetitions of locations and objectives in its final third, prevent 343 Industries from reaching the firmament. However, it remains a particularly solid FPS, which should keep you busy for a good fifteen hours of fun and to which you will certainly return with pleasure once the co-op mode is available."
1518,76,Halo Infinite,80,Checkpoint Gaming,"Dec  5, 2021","Master Chief is back and better than ever. Halo Infinite introduces open-world elements that don’t distract from the main story and add value to its replayability and memorable action. Even with the inclusion of the thrilling Grappleshot, the gameplay still maintains its signature feel. Multiplayer may need a lot of finetuning, but it costs nothing to play and provides plenty of frantic fun for a group of friends and solo players. With more features and additions to come, Halo Infinite isn’t slowing down… No. I think we’re just getting started."
1519,76,Halo Infinite,80,PCGamesN,"Dec  5, 2021","A phenomenal single-player experience that competes with the best this iconic series has to offer. Multiplayer needs a fair few structural tweaks, but still ultimately sparks joy."
1520,76,Halo Infinite,80,The Loadout,"Dec  5, 2021","Halo Infinite offers the full Master Chief experience in a big, beautiful sandbox. While 343 may not be breaking new ground with the light open-world elements it has added, it has done a great job of creating a solid experience for new and returning players alike."
1521,76,Halo Infinite,78,PC Gamer,"Dec  6, 2021","Halo Infinite can't quite deliver on being an open-world throwback, but it's the best shooting the series has seen to date."
1522,76,Halo Infinite,76,COGconnected,"Dec  5, 2021","I've shared many gripes I have with Halo Infinite. I've shared them meticulously because I love this franchise and want it to continue succeeding. Beyond them all, I absolutely love playing it. The campaign's open-world gameplay is phenomenal, and I can't wait to play through it again on legendary, especially with a friend in the future. Despite my disappointment in the narrative, the lead performances are strong, and the presentation is cinematic. I've been playing Halo multiplayer with my friends for nearly twenty years. We've kept up with the Master Chief Collection over the years, but Infinite is the most addicted we've been in a long time. It's far from perfect, but I can't wait to see how Halo Infinite evolves over the coming months and years."
1523,76,Halo Infinite,75,GameByte,"Dec  7, 2021","Overall, the 16 hours I spent with the Halo Infinite campaign certainly had dull points. However, sheer thrill shines through at several points, proving that there’s still life in this 20-year-old franchise. It’s now up to 343 Industries to keep it that way."
1524,76,Halo Infinite,75,Gaming Age,"Dec  6, 2021","All in all, Halo Infinite is a bit of a mixed bag. The multiplayer is on track to be the best it has ever been, but a lot of the campaign feels like an afterthought. There is a great, focused story there but it is sidetracked and bogged down in the attempts to bring it to the open world. A cluttered map and boring open-world missions fill the empty time in between the outstanding main missions, but the quality of those missions only serves to further highlight the disparity between the two. Those complaints, coupled with the fact that the campaign is the *only* part of the game that you have to pay for, make suggesting the purchase a bit difficult. Ultimately, what I will tell people is “check it out on Game Pass”, and I think that is maybe what Microsoft wanted all along."
1525,76,Halo Infinite,75,Game Revolution,"Dec  6, 2021","It’s clear that there’s tons of potential here, and there’s so much to love about what 343 Industries has already introduced, but playing it at launch feels like you’re playing the worst version of what could rightly wind up being a fantastic game. Game Pass lets subscribers experience games like Halo Infinite on a whim, and it also lets developers like 343 take risks on launching a “Halo platform” that’s a work-in-progress. Currently, its single-player campaign is fun if somewhat empty, while its multiplayer flickers between exhilarating and frustrating."
1526,76,Halo Infinite,70,Games.cz,"Jan 13, 2022","The new Halo game is far from flawless. There’s no co-op, even though there should be, and there’s a boring open world, even though there shouldn’t. The multiplayer feels unfinished as well. Still, at its core, it’s a solid story-driven shooter with a more-than-acceptable Cortana replacement."
1527,76,Halo Infinite,70,Attack of the Fanboy,"Dec  6, 2021","Halo Infinite might be kind of underwhelming on the single player side, but multiplayer has tons of promise if 343 can tackle launch issues swiftly."
1528,76,Halo Infinite,65,Riot Pixels,"Jan 22, 2022","Halo Infinite was supposed to become a flagship title for “the most powerful console in the world,” but in reality we got an interlude of a story devoid of epic set pieces, a template for something greater that may or may not arrive in the future, an empty “open world” punctuated with interior design circa early 2000s. If not for the awesome shootouts, Master Chief should have been jettisoned back into space."
1529,76,Halo Infinite,60,Slant Magazine,"Dec 15, 2021","The game runs away from any grand moment of clarity, skipping over self-reflection and settling for the thrill of nostalgia."
1530,77,Impostor Factory,93,IGN Italia,"Oct  7, 2021","Yet another masterpiece by Kan Gao, probably the most solid and balanced overall. The story of Quincy and Lynri passes through regrets, remorse, fears and IF. Gao's writing is always impeccable and is capable of never falling into the banal, even when it touches themes already abused in the medium and in narration in general. So far my very personal best game of the year."
1531,77,Impostor Factory,91,RPG Fan,"Sep 30, 2021","Writing a review for games like this feels bizarre to me, because synthesizing the work down to a number honestly feels wrong. It’s akin to going into an art gallery and scoring each painting or sculpture, and while that seems like I’m laying the praise on a bit thick, I genuinely feel this way. Whenever I’ve been in a slump or felt lost, a good book or movie with something to say has always been the best prescription. Impostor Factory can be that antidote for those who need it. Thank you, Kan, and thank you, Freebird Games. You’ve created an outstanding trilogy, and I absolutely, unequivocally, cannot wait to see what you do next. You have a supporter for life."
1532,77,Impostor Factory,81,SpazioGames,"Oct 25, 2021","It’s really unfair assign a mark to this game. It’s unfair not because it’s a bad game, but because it’s complex and almost disrespectful to crush this work into a sterile number. A videogame that is also a “non-videogame”, and it knowingly turns this flaw into strength, telling us a love story that turns into a reflection upon reality and the nature of choosing, surrounding it with a beautiful painting done with pixels."
1533,77,Impostor Factory,80,Meristation,"Nov 16, 2021","This is Freebird's best work, a narrative driven game emotionally packed, but also full of humor and great characters."

1535,77,Impostor Factory,80,Siliconera,"Oct 25, 2021","Impostor Factory is a surprisingly beautiful game that questions what it means to have a meaningful life. It tells a cyclical narrative that still manages to feel honest and emotionally raw. It works best if you go into it with as little information as possible, so I won’t say much more than that on how the story unfolds. It is a bit predictable and slow moving. Still it tells incredibly competent story that surprised me with how evocative it was. In the end, the bits of sc-fi and the explanation of an AI-driven time loop were the perfect additions to a game so deeply entrenched in human emotion. Impostor Factory knows what it’s about and delivers on that point."
1536,77,Impostor Factory,80,The Indie Game Website,"Oct 21, 2021","Freebird games have always been funny in a gentle way that doesn’t clash with the games’ tender yet challenging emotional core. In Impostor Factory, the team has taken a big swing by including full-on horror, as well as a complex meta-story involving the nature of science and time itself. And the humor is both slapstick and risky, letting players release tension as they explore the gore and mind-bending moral conundrums posed by the game’s story. The boxing cat and the sentient rice cooker are a welcome bonus."
1537,77,Impostor Factory,80,Eurogamer Italy,"Oct  8, 2021","Impostor Factory clearly shows the growth of its author. The topics dealt with may not fit everyone's tastes, just as we definitely feel the void left by the sparkling interactions between the two protagonists of the previous chapters; however, Kan Gao seems to have clear ideas about the direction his saga is taking, as well as an increasingly refined talent for causing emotional devastation to the players."
1538,77,Impostor Factory,80,Multiplayer.it,"Oct  7, 2021","Impostor Factory doesn't punch emotionally like To The Moon and Finding Paradise, but Kan Gao's and Freebird Games' skills are still intact."
1539,77,Impostor Factory,80,Hey Poor Player,"Oct  5, 2021","Impostor Factory offers yet another tear-jerking, emotional roller coaster with murder mystery flair. The very definition of bittersweet, Impostor Factory’s emotional climax will only make sense to those familiar with the series, so if this is your first foray into the franchise, please grab To The Moon and Finding Paradise first before diving into this sentimental adventure. Where To the Moon sought fantasy from reality and Finding Paradise sought reality from fantasy, Impostor Factory blends them together in a beautifully unexpected way, reminding us to live life while we have it. If you want a wonderfully well-written story with fully fleshed out characters and thoughtfully choreographed scenes that feel charmingly cinematic, please play Impostor Factory (after To The Moon and Finding Paradise, of course!)."
1540,77,Impostor Factory,80,Everyeye.it,"Sep 30, 2021","Impostor Factory teases and deceives, involves and strangles. It doesn't have the destabilizing power of To The Moon, nor the brain balance of Finding Paradise, but that's okay."
1541,77,Impostor Factory,70,Adventure Gamers,"Nov 29, 2021","Looking better than ever but reducing the gameplay elements even further, Impostor Factory manages to weave a supernatural time travel murder mystery starring a whole new character into the series’ existing tapestry, giving the game a unique-yet-familiar flavor."
1542,77,Impostor Factory,67,New Game Network,"Oct 28, 2021","On its own, Impostor Factory is a decent adventure with occasionally interesting story elements and mostly enjoyable dialogue. But as part of the otherwise great series, it's a disappointing misstep."
1543,78,The Legend of Tianding,95,Softpedia,"Nov 16, 2021","The Legend of Tianding shows how indie developers can mix solid mechanics and cool history-based protagonists to deliver a fresh take on the classic side-scrolling brawler experience. The game is tough but fair, asking players to master a series of moves and constantly finding new ways to test their skills. I would have liked less backtracking and, maybe, more meaningful side quests but simply engaging with the core missions is very fun. The Taiwan historical setting mixes very well with the presentation. More developers should try to use universes that have not been previously explored to add another dimension to their titles. And all fans of the genre should play The Legend of Tianding to enjoy its many good ideas and great execution."
1544,78,The Legend of Tianding,89,Ragequit.gr,"Nov 22, 2021","The Legend of Tianding is a surprise game that we liked more than we expected. The level of production is high, while all its individual elements are harmoniously linked together (brawling, platforming, visual novel), accompanied by a quite interesting story and a likeable protagonist. For fans of the genre (and not only to them) it is highly recommended."
1545,78,The Legend of Tianding,85,KeenGamer,"Nov  8, 2021","The Legend of Tian Ding has its imperfections, especially in some story aspects and its difficulty. But overall, it provides a perfect insight into the history of Taiwan during the colonial period, while also providing incredible combat and platforming to make you feel like a true kung fu master. The legend of this game will surely be told in the generations to come."
1546,78,The Legend of Tianding,83,Gaming Age,"Nov  2, 2021","Much like the story of the man it is “based on”, I think people will be unaware of this extremely competent title. It’s a tad short for my liking, but it is an otherwise complete experience. Hopefully the game’s marketing team will find the right influencers to champion this title. Those who do find it will get a chance to experience an enjoyable game and learn about the colonial history of an area that increasingly finds itself on the world stage."
1547,78,The Legend of Tianding,80,Vandal,"Nov  9, 2021","The Legend of Tianding offers a great gameplay, fluid and responsive, and adds a unique setting and some interesting mechanics to make it an adventure that’s worth your time."
1548,78,The Legend of Tianding,80,Noisy Pixel,"Oct 28, 2021","Aside from its highly brief playtime and minor use of fetch quests, The Legend of Tianding is an excellent beat’em up action platformer that touches upon a cultural figure that has been mostly forgotten. The polished and fleshed-out combat, along with the brilliant art design and Taiwanese voice-acted dialogue, makes this a thrilling historical adventure with a strong foundation for what can be an anthology of forgotten ethnic heroes."
1549,78,The Legend of Tianding,79,Gamersky,"Dec  2, 2021","The Legend of Tianding is a sketch game of upper middle quality. There are some issues that will affect the game experience to a certain extent, such as the repetitive late miscellaneous battle, unclear mission guidance, bugs of individual levels in the design. But the refreshing experience of the plot, like reading the Hong Kong comics, is very unique."
1550,78,The Legend of Tianding,70,Meristation,"Dec 28, 2021","The Legend of Tian Ding woks great and exhibit his charm when you actually play on the very beautifully drawn streets of Taipei. The problem comes when you realize that you will spend half of your time reading. Even with that, this game's charm is unquestionable."
1551,78,The Legend of Tianding,70,GameOver.gr,"Dec 24, 2021","The Legend of Tianding gives the impression that it’s inspired by a Taiwanese comic, even none exists. This is a testament to the developer’s ability in crafting an especially believable comic aesthetic. In addition, its arcadey beat ‘m up-centric gameplay provides an entertaining short action-game even though it doesn’t try in the least to provide any unique gameplay element or depth to its formula."
1552,79,Dandy Ace,90,GameSpace,"Apr 26, 2021",I found the game to be well worth the $20 price tag given its polished story with voice acting and extreme replay value but you don't have to take my word for it; you can find a free demo on the Steam page and give it a go for yourself. You won't be sorry.
1553,79,Dandy Ace,90,Noisy Pixel,"Apr  1, 2021","Dandy Ace is a colorful, magical action roguelike that’s consistent in its design and fascinating in its unique theme choice. With its card combination system for skills at the forefront, it can offer some good hours of fun and experimentation during battles."
1554,79,Dandy Ace,90,PC Invasion,"Mar 25, 2021","Dandy Ace is a sensational roguelike that can contend with the very best the genre has to offer. Although gameplay can get a little repetitive, its colorful visuals and well-thought-out combat mechanics more than make up for that. This is a challenging yet fun game that is well worth your time."

1556,79,Dandy Ace,80,GameCritics,"May 28, 2021","I enjoy roguelikes in general and I did enjoy the card-combining mechanics overall, but it feels a bit like the window for Dandy Ace‘s success has now closed."
1557,79,Dandy Ace,80,TheSixthAxis,"May  6, 2021","Overall, I like Dandy Ace a fair bit, but the story doesn't do quite enough to drive you to do more runs, and there were a few times when things felt grossly unfair due to the sheer volume of enemies that some rooms spit at you. The card combination system is wonderful to use though, and that'll keep mechanically-minded players involved for a fair while with Dandy Ace."
1558,79,Dandy Ace,80,Shacknews,"Apr  1, 2021","Dandy Ace delivers as a challenging roguelike, with difficult enemies and bosses galore. The use of cards allows players the freedom to fine-tune their loadout to be the most efficient for their respective playstyle. Add on top of that the visually pleasing art style and use of color, and you’ve got yourself one magical roguelike."
1559,79,Dandy Ace,80,Cultured Vultures,"Mar 24, 2021","Dandy Ace is a fun roguelike with a memorable cast of characters and a unique combat system, but it lacks enough evolution between difficulties to offer motivation beyond just the challenge of completing it."
1560,79,Dandy Ace,80,Multiplayer.it,"Mar 24, 2021",Dandy Ace is all about skill management. Rogue-lite fans should certainly give the game a chance.
1561,79,Dandy Ace,70,DarkZero,"Apr 14, 2021","There are some rough edges here but knowing that the team is actively working with the community to sharpen them up is a fantastic sign and I fully believe that if they keep it up, Dandy Ace will be a force to be reckoned with."
1562,79,Dandy Ace,70,Screen Rant,"Mar 24, 2021","While Dandy Ace comes from a smaller development team, it’s a fun action-roguelike already, with room to possibly grow in post-launch updates. There are elements which certainly need to be updated or retuned - higher-level spells don’t change in appearance with each tier, something which never seems right, and levels are, on the whole, much too long - but the playful spell system, upbeat style, and overall polish definitely make it worth a spin for action-roguelike fans."
1563,79,Dandy Ace,70,Eurogamer Italy,"Mar 24, 2021","Dandy Ace tries the way followed by titles like Hades and Dead Cells looking for a humbler path and lighter colors. Although poor in terms of narration, Mad Mimic's game knows how to be appreciated for its peculiar gameplay."
1564,80,Diablo II: Resurrected,95,CGMagazine,"Sep 28, 2021","Even without the nostalgia creeping in, one can plainly see that this is a game for the ages. Cross-play would make this the perfect release for me, but even as is, I love this game."
1565,80,Diablo II: Resurrected,92,Ragequit.gr,"Jan 10, 2022","Diablo 2 remains an addictive experience capable of keeping you busy for hours. The endgame grind shows how far the genre has moved forward to embellish the loot piata, but its itemization remains unsurpassed and an example to follow."

There's not much here in the way of additions or changes, which is definitely a wasted opportunity to practically offer the best ARPG ever made, but it's still hard to say no to such a devilishly good remaster. Good job Blizzard. Finally."

It preserves the original game in amber while still showing just why it was considered a legendary game in the first place.

1569,80,Diablo II: Resurrected,90,LevelUp,"Sep 28, 2021","Vicarious Visions and Blizzard Entertainment have done something amazing with Diablo II: Resurrected. It is much more than a tribute. It is a sign that the first game is unrepeatable and that it remains so fresh despite the years (at least for some, because it is evident that it aged particularly badly). Therefore, Diablo II: Resurrected is a careful recommendation. It is a game for veterans of the original, fans and curious."

Hell has never felt like such a warm bath."
1572,80,Diablo II: Resurrected,88,Game Informer,"Sep 23, 2021","Diablo II: Resurrected shows why the original title remains the standard against which all other ARPGs are judged. While it doesn’t come with many hooks and ever-evolving content that has become a baseline for the genre as it transformed into a game-as-service model, not all games need to be played with forever in mind. Diablo II: Resurrected proves that Blizzard’s classic is still a blast, even today. Whether it’s your first foray into hell and beyond or your thousandth hour, Diablo II: Resurrected is worth the time."

It looks infinitely better, it’s more accessible to a wider range of gamers, and it mostly feels like it deserves to live on current-gen systems. At the same time, some of the changes seem arbitrary when looked at through the lens of what could have, and should have, been updated. Part of Diablo II: Resurrected feels wonderfully nostalgic and timeless, but another part feels mired in outdated mechanics from decades past, and pretty graphics alone can’t fix that."

The atmosphere of the game is as crazy as ever even though the storytelling has gotten a little old. The same can be said with the gameplay, which has hardly changed an iota: it's still just as nervous, addicting, devilishly catchy, but at the cost of sometimes outdated ergonomics. Nevertheless, we do not shy away from our pleasure of replaying this legend in conditions much more in line with what is being done in 2021."
1587,80,Diablo II: Resurrected,80,PC Games,"Oct  4, 2021","Even after more than 20 years, smashing monsters and looting to your hearts content is as addicting as ever. A fantastic visual overhaul and some much-needed improvements make this the best version of Diablo 2 so far. However, a lot of outdated mechanics remain untouched, from shared loot and uneven balancing to an overflowing inventory that constantly interrupts the action. Even basic stuff like stackable gems or some useful tutorial screens didn't make it into this remaster. Blizzard is clearly catering to fans of the original, even if that means the remaster may never reach its full potential."

Diablo 2 Resurrected on PC

Diablo 2: Resurrected is a remaster simultaneously complex, and also incredibly simple. Visually, it’s a night and day difference between its predecessor, even on the Switch. But from a gameplay perspective, it is incredibly faithful, almost to a fault. Very little has been changed from the original release which will likely be music to the ears of the most hardcore Diablo 2 fans, resistant to change. In that sense, it’s a very “simple” upgrade. However, that decision not to use this opportunity to spruce things up may end up being a thorn at the side of newcomers and fans without rose-tinted glasses.

Let’s talk about what Diablo 2: Resurrected gets right first. Visually Diablo 2: Resurrected is a triumph. It takes a very old game that looks, let’s face it, like ass by today’s standards, and turns it into something charming and wonderful to behold. By charming and wonderful, I of course mean gory, gothic, and dark with a new level of detail that was not possible in the original game. Fans wouldn’t have it any other way in that regard.

Gameplay-wise, very little has changed because very little needed to change. Diablo 2 is still an all-time great game and that is still the case in Resurrected.

All of the game’s classes are incredibly distinct from each other and each has a multitude of different play styles you can elect to spec into. There are Trap Assassins, Elementalist Assassins, Bow Amazons, Javasons, Werewolf Druids, Werebear Druids, Hammerdins, Whirlwind Barbs, Summoner Necros, and Bone Necros, Ice, Fire, and Thunder Sorceresses, I could go on and on.

Layered on top of that are gear and set items that can further augment your gameplay and of course the fabled Runewords that players can chase to really perfect their builds. Leveraging all of that and creating your perfect character is definitely a grind. It’s a grind that may not make sense to an outsider, because at the end of the day you’re just running through the same content you did before, just faster, but those of us that love the genre do get it and love it for what it is.

What’s great too is that players now have an easier way of getting to experience the lore, environment, and story of Diablo 2. Diablo 3 had a really compelling story that is heavily connected to the events of Diablo 2. While you can still enjoy Diablo 3 without having ever played its predecessor, it’s far more enjoyable if you do know fully what’s going on. And with Diablo 4 coming at some point in the future, it’s absolutely worth a single playthrough for the story and to experience this legendary game at least once, even if you’re not planning on staying a while or killing Baal 10,000 times.

All of that said, while yes, Diablo 2 is still an excellent game, it never was a perfect game, and there are some issues that were forgivable back when it was originally released that stick out like sore thumbs now in Diablo 2: Resurrected.

I have extremely fond memories of Diablo 2 going back to my days in middle school and high school. My friends and I would spend hours perfecting our magic find gear and mastering our speed runs through Mephisto and Baal to grind for better loot.

The funny thing about memories, though, is that sometimes your brain selectively chooses to remember good ones, and deletes all of the bad ones.

For example, I barely remembered that Stamina was even a thing, and yeah it’s very much a drag early on. While it improves over time as you pump up your Vitality, I can totally see fans that are not married to the idea of loving Diablo 2, getting frustrated very easily over it, and giving up on it before it starts to resolve itself.

If the frequent battles with your Stamina in the early game don’t scare players away, the inventory management might. This is another Diablo 2 memory I subconsciously left behind apparently.

I do not remember having to constantly go into my inventory to either drop stuff, or go back and forth to town to stash and sell items as often as I apparently need to while playing Diablo 2: Resurrected.

Did I just never pick things up in the original game? Did I just not know anything better back then? I don’t know the answer to those questions, but the reality is that in 2021 it’s kind of brutal and not in a good way. Your choices are basically to be extremely selective on what you decide to stop and pick up and then possibly miss out on upgrades, or just spend most of your gameplay time in your inventory.

While I’m fortunate that the version of Diablo 2 that contained respeccing made it into Diablo 2: Resurrected, I would have really preferred to just have unlimited respeccing as you do in Diablo 3. As it stands, it’s a pain in the ass to experiment and you’ll need to really commit to your play style and resort to starting a new character if you want to have easy access to something different.

Finally, let me just also add, that the lack of a local couch co-op option for console players is a total bummer. I have to imagine, considering Diablo 3 had the option, that it probably wasn’t a philosophical choice, but rather it probably just wasn’t possible. Still, that doesn’t make it any less of a disappointment.

I know that hardcore Diablo 2 fans don’t want to even entertain the idea of Diablo 3 seeping into their beloved game; I totally get that sentiment and don’t want a watered-down version of Diablo 2 either. However, a few modern touches, addressing the three biggest pain points I mentioned above would have gone a long way to properly resurrecting Diablo 2 and making it a premier ARPG in 2021. It doesn’t reach that potential, sadly, but it’s still an all-time great game that mostly holds up as long as you can look past its dated features."
1589,80,Diablo II: Resurrected,80,PC Gamer,"Sep 29, 2021","Beneath the beautiful new look and smart innovations, this is the same Diablo 2 that came out in 2000."
1590,80,Diablo II: Resurrected,80,Eurogamer Italy,"Sep 29, 2021","Diablo 2 Resurrected is what a remaster should be. Vicarious Visions has done an incredible job with what is the cornerstone of the Action RPG genre. A visual gem that still holds against any modern title. The gameplay hasn’t changed an inch, which is what the whole community wanted. More brutal than ever. An isometric Dark Souls to terrorize the new generations of gamers."
1591,80,Diablo II: Resurrected,80,PCGamesN,"Sep 29, 2021","Successfully brings an icon into the modern era, and the underlying gameplay still shines. But while Resurrected does a better job than Warcraft III: Reforged, it leaves similar questions unanswered over its feature set and long-term community support."
1592,80,Diablo II: Resurrected,80,Everyeye.it,"Sep 28, 2021","Overall, however, we can only be satisfied with the outcome of the nostalgia operation implemented by Blizzard, which will once again trap fans in an endless cycle of fights to the death and unbridled looting."
1593,80,Diablo II: Resurrected,80,Hardcore Gamer,"Sep 28, 2021","The lore of Diablo is as interesting as it ever was even if the storytelling isn’t nearly as fleshed out as one would see in modern games. Giving a facelift to a twenty-year-old game without updating the gameplay is a gamble, but thankfully that is exactly what we got with Diablo II: Resurrected which is how the original fans would want it."
1594,80,Diablo II: Resurrected,80,Game Rant,"Sep 28, 2021","At the end of the day, Diablo 2: Resurrected certainly feels like a game that is designed with veteran and nostalgic players in mind and it truly nails the experience in that sense. Whether it’s going to be able to build a new audience with first-time players is a much tougher question, but the old school experience may have more to offer modern gamers than it appears at first glance. Diablo 2: Resurrected fills a very unique spot in the franchise’s offerings by allowing players to continue returning to D3 (and someday Diablo 4 for a modern experience), but also now having a visually modern option when they want a bit more baseline difficulty and a classic experience."
1595,80,Diablo II: Resurrected,80,Multiplayer.it,"Sep 23, 2021",Quotation forthcoming.
1596,80,Diablo II: Resurrected,75,Worth Playing,"Oct  7, 2021","If you don't run afoul of the game's technical and server-related issues, you'll find Diablo II: Resurrected to be a good version of the classic action RPG. For those who have played with the 2000 PC classic countless times, this is a like-for-like copy of that title, only with a few more accessibility options and a new lick of paint so it blends in with modern releases. For those who are new to the game or are more familiar with Diablo III, keyboard and mouse players will feel limited, while the lack of modern quality-of-life amenities can dampen the excitement for the title. Either way, once everything clears up, Diablo II can become a great addition to any ARPG library, and if you're one who pays attention to the review score, you can bump up the number when the fixes roll in."
1597,80,Diablo II: Resurrected,75,GRYOnline.pl,"Oct  4, 2021","Diablo 2 Resurrected is a beautiful journey down memory lane. It's a game that brings out memories and joy and, sometimes, rage (it can be brutally unforgiving). This new-old Diablo 2 took us home for a while. A sweet illusion, but its longevity depends on the work the developers still have to do."
1598,80,Diablo II: Resurrected,75,MGG,"Sep 23, 2021","Diablo 2 Resurrected has a stunning graphical overhaul as well as satisfactory controller support, but it's really not a remaster for the masses: it's primarily aimed at fans of the original title. Nostalgia won't necessarily be enough to make you forget the lack of modernization of many interface or gameplay elements. So it struggles to compete with the many newer games in the same genre on many levels. Let's hope for more changes in the future. Even if it doesn't impose itself as a modern title, we still recommend it to players looking to discover this great classic in good conditions, knowing that it offers an almost unlimited life span to those who are hooked on its old formula."
1599,80,Diablo II: Resurrected,70,Gfinity,"Oct 10, 2021","Diablo 2 Resurrected should have been a remake. The approach might be more streamlined than most modern RPGs, and combat is just as enjoyable as it ever was. However, it's also difficult to recommend for those unwilling to push back against the game at almost every turn. If you're familiar with the original and know its quirks already, the visual refresh is enough to warrant yet another playthrough."
1600,80,Diablo II: Resurrected,70,Attack of the Fanboy,"Oct  4, 2021","Diablo 2: Resurrected both benefits and suffers from its faithfulness to the original title, but overall provides an adventure full of satisfying gameplay and fun exploration."
1601,80,Diablo II: Resurrected,70,IGN,"Oct  1, 2021","Diablo 2: Resurrected updates the graphics of a great, classic action RPG for a new generation. It masterfully preserves the mood of a singular game, and at the same time it preserves the gameplay as it has been for over a decade – mostly for better, occasionally for worse. Unfortunately, parts of that gameplay that were standard 20 years ago just look bad now, or feel like a waste of our time. Those looking for the old king can find it right here, but they might want to politely bow rather than kneel."
1602,80,Diablo II: Resurrected,70,Shacknews,"Sep 29, 2021","As a big Diablo 2 fan, Resurrected has let me down in many ways. What little changes have been made to the original formula are welcome, but feel like leftover bread crumbs from a larger pie that could have been. Diablo 2 was in a bit of a weird place in that it was not hard at all to access and play the original game, even on modern PC hardware. This new release does make the game available to console audiences, which is an awesome change, but the lack of crossplay really hurts here. Resurrected could end up becoming a much better value down the road as the development team begins introducing updates and upgrades, but as of right now, you should avoid this package unless you are happy with straight-up Diablo 2. That being said, there are many reasons to be thrilled to revisit the game, particularly for the timeless soundtrack and to get a glance at the spiffy new paint job. Just make sure to set your expectations accordingly."
1603,80,Diablo II: Resurrected,70,Stevivor,"Sep 27, 2021","Eventually, and with a lot of googling, I found my groove and started to enjoy what Resurrected has to offer. Just make sure you go in prepared for the clunkiness."
1604,80,Diablo II: Resurrected,70,Dexerto,"Sep 23, 2021","Diablo 2 Resurrected achieves what it set out to do: remaster Diablo 2. Its enhanced visuals and spectacular cinematics repackage the game in a whole new way, making it feel as though it really is your first playthrough all over again.
Breaking this immersion, though, are a slew of irritating bugs that are likely to be fixed soon. As patches drop over time we hope this sorts itself out, but at the moment they can be so game-breaking that they make you want to do diabolical things to your computer. Despite all of this, I’m excited to jump back into the game. In fact, I’m itching to do it. Why? Because evil has returned, and it’s the Diablo 2 I know and love."
1605,80,Diablo II: Resurrected,65,PlaySense,"Oct  5, 2021","The beloved classic returns with a lot of promise… but it doesn’t quite meet our lofty expectations. It looks, sounds and plays great, but there are downsides: you’ll find loads of bugs and glitches, some important features are missing and it turns out you can actually be too faithful to the original."
1606,80,Diablo II: Resurrected,60,GameSpot,"Sep 29, 2021","It's why, unlike Diablo III, I don't foresee myself spending a lot more time with Diablo II: Resurrected. That's not to say the adventure was without merit, and it's certainly great to have a way to play one of Blizzard's classics with a coat of paint that does its visual aesthetic justice so many years later. But outside of players already well-versed with the game's aged design choices and imbalance, there's not a lot here outside of a history lesson for new players to enjoy. A lot of the time spent playing Diablo II: Resurrected, I just longed to return to Diablo III."
1607,80,Diablo II: Resurrected,60,Checkpoint Gaming,"Sep 29, 2021","Diablo 2: Resurrected is, if anything, a faithful remaster of the original game. The visual overhaul and fantastic cinematics maintain the dark tone of Sanctuary’s horrifying demons and tales. Unfortunately, that alone doesn’t hold up after 20 years of innovation. Annoying gameplay mechanics, constant selling and buying, restrictive controls, regressive character art, and finicky UI poorly date this adventure. More quality of life changes should be here to truly bring the classic back to life. Diablo fans may love this remaster; others will likely not."
1608,81,The Artful Escape,100,Windows Central,"Sep  8, 2021","The Artful Escape has been in the works since around 2015, and the effort shows. The game is precise in what it wants to portray and doesn't overstay its welcome. It tells a contained story about one guy, his famous uncle, and the whole of the cosmos, and does it well. It's also a story about the power of music, the art of creating, and the journey to becoming your true self. You can take what you want from it, make it one of your best comfort games if you want, but at the very least, it's a cool game to look at. It'll look great as one of the best Xbox games joining Xbox Game Pass this month."
1609,81,The Artful Escape,100,Checkpoint Gaming,"Sep  8, 2021","The Artful Escape is a story about legacies, finding yourself, change and transition that presents itself in such an ingenious way that all can absolutely enjoy it. Gliding across the cosmos, playing electric guitar in unknown lands, and eventually vanquishing a divine complication with intricate audio design and superb music to accompany – it’s perplexing how captivating this interstellar adventure is. Inviting players on a musical journey through cosmic realms and challenging introspection, The Artful Escape is a masterpiece."
1610,81,The Artful Escape,90,The Indie Game Website,"Oct  4, 2021","By the time the final credits roll on The Artful Escape, it’s a challenge to succinctly summarise what you’ve just experienced. It’s a game without a genre, one composed of familiar elements blended in an unfamiliar way, creating something that is uniquely its own. It’s been a long time coming since The Artful Escape was given its initial glimpse of what was in store, but when it’s all said and done, it leaves the audience satisfied but still wanting just a little more. Like any good concert."
1611,81,The Artful Escape,90,GameOver.gr,"Sep 17, 2021","The Artful Escape definitely belongs to one of these games that appear almost out of nowhere, just to make us happy and blessed to try out. While not a title for platformer aficionados and those who crave for something challenging, The Artful Escape ends up being a pleasant surprise, and one that will stay within for long."
1612,81,The Artful Escape,90,Gaming Nexus,"Sep 15, 2021","The Artful Escape tells a heartfelt story of artistic self-discovery through a filter of color, light, sound, and joy. Combining gonzo sci-fi imagery with blaring space-rock guitar chords, The Artful Escape is a playable concept album – or at least a grand trip through that album’s cover art. Never difficult but always fun, The Artful Escape is highly recommended as both a great narrative and a fun exploration into Bowie-style space rock imagery."
1613,81,The Artful Escape,90,Gameblog.fr,"Sep 10, 2021","After almost 2 years without being able to attend a concert normally, those who claim to be music lovers have the opportunity with The Artful Escape to participate in what comes closest to it : a rock and roll narrative experience. Ready to battle with Psychonauts 2 for the title of the most colorful artistic direction of the year, puffing up with color and good humor, with a fantastic soundtrack, the first project of Beethoven & Dinosaur does not disappoint. His neat writing, his crazy ans so well interpreted characters and his themes largely allow him to forget that it has not a lot to offer gameplaywise. One of the sunrays of 2021, unmissable if you have always dreamed of becoming a rockstar and dazzling an audience in delirium with your most melodious riffs."
1614,81,The Artful Escape,90,Gamepressure,"Sep 10, 2021","In the end, its expert cast, beautiful worlds, and clever writing together tell a very stimulating story of discovery, despite its otherwise quirky exterior."
1615,81,The Artful Escape,90,GamesRadar+,"Sep  8, 2021",The Artful Escape is a short but oh-so-sweet platformer that will have you bopping to its impossibly catch beats and transfixed by its beauty.
1616,81,The Artful Escape,85,KeenGamer,"Sep 17, 2021",The Artful Escape is a hypnotic journey about legacy and self-discovery. The developers have managed to tell an inspiring story about being yourself no matter what. The journey is the perfect length and often surprised me with its tenderness and soul. Stunning visuals and a catchy soundtrack helped elevate the experience into something I don't think I will forget anytime soon.
1617,81,The Artful Escape,85,Vandal,"Sep  8, 2021","A fantastic musical adventure with its unique, wacky style that clashes (in a good way) with a cosmic setting and emotional themes."
1618,81,The Artful Escape,82,IGN Italia,"Sep  9, 2021","The Artful Escape is a powerful and aesthetically wonderful generational hymn, which sounds great and uses gameplay as a subtle way to give rhythm to a short, but intense, experience."
1619,81,The Artful Escape,80,TierraGamer,"Nov 11, 2021","The Artful Escape might seem easy to some players, but its flawless and engaging music and art direction make it worth your time."
1620,81,The Artful Escape,80,TrueGaming,"Sep 21, 2021","The Artful Escape is an exquisite experience in every aspect. The psychedelic nature of the story keeps things interesting, plus a visually appealing presentation and a great soundtrack."
1621,81,The Artful Escape,80,Slant Magazine,"Sep 20, 2021","The Artful Escape may lack depth of interactivity, but in the end, the game is more of a trippy coming-of-age story than it is a career mode in Rock Band."
1622,81,The Artful Escape,80,GameSpot,"Sep 14, 2021","Challenging as that may be, The Artful Escape is nevertheless a thrilling adventure that commits fully to showcasing its gorgeous art in soaring set pieces. Though some of the dialogue doesn’t work, the game is largely successful at stripping out anything that would distract from its masterful presentation. Unlike Francis Vendetti at the beginning of his journey, The Artful Escape knows exactly what it is."
1623,81,The Artful Escape,80,Multiplayer.it,"Sep  8, 2021",The Artful Escape is an awesome musical experience but you need to accept this is something very similar to a walking simulator.
1624,81,The Artful Escape,80,IGN,"Sep  8, 2021",There hasn’t been a guitar-based adventure as excellent as The Artful Escape since Bill met Ted.
1625,81,The Artful Escape,80,Attack of the Fanboy,"Sep  8, 2021","The Artful Escape provides a strong narrative adventure focused on self-discovery, identity, and expression that musicians, artists, and just about anyone can find something to relate to."
1626,81,The Artful Escape,75,Meristation,"Oct 21, 2021","The Artful Escape focuses the attention on the narrative through a powerful audiovisual staging, reducing the platforms and the challenge to the minimum expression to provide the player with an authentic festival of rock, psychedelia and surrealism."
1627,81,The Artful Escape,75,PC Gamer,"Sep 17, 2021",An eye-popping musical adventure that will leave you with a serious case of galaxy brain.
1628,81,The Artful Escape,75,Digital Chumps,"Sep  9, 2021","The Artful Escape is a visual and audio masterpiece that creates a sincere narrative that gives hope to any struggling would-be artist that they will find their own voice at the end of a tough journey. As good as that message might be, the gameplay mechanics don’t nearly live up to the hype the rest of the game creates."
1629,81,The Artful Escape,75,Jeuxvideo.com,"Sep  9, 2021","Highly contemplative, utterly eccentric and absolutely magnificent, The Artful Escape offers a visual and sound experience that is as puzzling as it is thrilling. But the beauty of the abstract can reach its limits when the nonsense ends up losing us. And the journey sometimes runs out of steam when the gameplay remains on its way. However, the journey remains relatively captivating up and down, both for its beauty and its uniqueness. But there is no doubt that it will be divisive."
1630,81,The Artful Escape,70,GamingTrend,"Sep  8, 2021","The Artful Escape perfectly encapsulates the feeling of being transported away by a David Bowie track to a far-out world filled with colorful characters and wildlife and great music, but its gameplay falls flat, offering little depth past its first tutorial. While the game is short enough for its systems to never feel too egregious, it never reaches its full potential through its story or its mechanics. Fans of zen games, nice visuals, and quippy dialogue may want to pick this up, but do not expect a deep experience in playing The Artful Escape."
1631,81,The Artful Escape,70,Wccftech,"Sep  8, 2021","The Artful Escape is a rockin' Space Opera but it doesn't have much going for it besides its pretty visuals and incredible music. The platforming is basic and the plot is serviceable, but it's nothing that audiences haven't seen before. I'd recommend this game only if you're a fan of rock music from the '70s and '80s."
1632,81,The Artful Escape,70,CGMagazine,"Sep  8, 2021","The Artful Escape has a stellar narrative with actual good humour enhanced by the voice acting talent and beautiful landscapes, but the gameplay is stale and those who dislike electric guitar are in for a long haul."
1633,81,The Artful Escape,65,Noisy Pixel,"Sep  8, 2021","I wanted to come away from The Artful Escape feeling inspired and changed, with a story to really mull over. I came into this four-to-five-hour experience with expectations set by early gameplay, and while some of them were met, I don't know that it does enough to really justify its choice of medium. It has got more than enough in terms of eye candy and audio bliss, but I can't confidently say that any of the other pieces manage to come together in this space oddity."
1634,81,The Artful Escape,60,Shacknews,"Sep  8, 2021","While The Artful Escape does a strong job with its presentation and sense of style, it still suffers the same drawbacks as most adventure games, particularly with the boring-at-best game mechanics. The celebrity voice cast does well enough, though I only recognized Weathers during my time in the game. The trip here isn’t long, though it does manage to be memorable thanks to its relentless desire to look like a Liz Frank-emblazoned Trapper Keeper. Depending on the drugs you keep handy, this could be the ticket."
1635,81,The Artful Escape,40,Screen Rant,"Sep  8, 2021","When characters are suddenly reintroduced in the finale, it’s noticeable how little a dent they made in this feather-weight narrative. The story can be completed in a few hours, and there’s occasional amusement and distraction in those hours, but absolutely no catharsis or narrative satisfaction, or even any interesting platforming. For such a visually boisterous experience, The Artful Escape feels more like a chilly museum after closing hours."
1636,82,Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster,90,Siliconera,"Aug  9, 2021","I like the original Final Fantasy, but I honestly haven’t touched it since the PlayStation release. I have tried to pick it up here and there, but find myself getting bored of the grind and the pace. The auto-battle injects so much energy into it that I couldn’t put the game down. Combined with the visuals and music, I just wanted to spend every minute playing Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster. It’s an excitement I haven’t felt for the original Final Fantasy in decades, and I hope the other entries capture the same feeling."
1637,82,Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster,90,Gamer Escape,"Aug  5, 2021","The biggest impediment to recommending these games to others is just the fact that, well… in many ways they are slight things. None of these games are terribly long if you know what you’re doing, nor are they tremendously difficult. The stories are not super compelling on their own. They are little games in a way, and they are definitely aged. But if you loved these games before, these remasters are perfect for what they’re trying to do. They’re charming. They feel like a sudden rush of nostalgia not because they’re exactly the games you remember, but the rare form of remaster that does add some stuff on top while still preserving all of the spirit and intent perfectly. And if you’ve never played these games but want to understand why people loved them so much, these are the perfect way to try them out."
1638,82,Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster,85,RPG Fan,"Jul 29, 2021","Overall, between the game’s story and gameplay, nothing sticks out as individually exceptional. Still, Final Fantasy comes together as an experience that is better than the sum of its parts. The Pixel Remaster does an excellent job of keeping the surprisingly well-aged gameplay that started the series intact while updating it with more modern pixel art and a beautiful soundtrack. Outside of a few confusing moments and poorly balanced bosses, Final Fantasy is a game I would readily recommend to modern RPG fans, and it’s a great introduction to the genre’s classics."
1639,82,Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster,85,CGMagazine,"Jul 29, 2021","The first three Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters deftly walk the line between old and new, but might not convert anyone without the stomach for old JRPGs."
1640,82,Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster,80,GamingTrend,"Nov 17, 2021","While the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters aren’t perfect, they’re certainly the best and most convenient ways to play these classic games. The soundtracks are lovingly orchestrated and the pixel art is gorgeous, though the latter does lose some detail in the translation. Each game feels great to play, but I do wish extra content from previous releases or remakes had been included."
1641,82,Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster,80,Gfinity,"Aug  5, 2021","So what we're left with is a slightly uneven collection. The core material is still brilliant, made exponentially more so with the stellar soundtracks and built-in music player, but you'll be a bit disappointed if you were hoping for anything other than the core material."
1642,82,Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster,80,Game Rant,"Aug  2, 2021","For fans of the classic series, or newcomers looking for a quality introduction into the older games, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster is a great way to experience the series. Then, of course, there are the hours and hours of content across all games in the collection to consider. It isn't perfect, but players can easily get lost in the same stories and endless combat that Square Enix first introduced with the original launch on NES."
1643,82,Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster,80,Hardcore Gamer,"Jul 29, 2021","The bottom line is Final Fantasy is simply a fun game, and Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster is a remake worthy of the title’s legacy."
1644,82,Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster,75,Worth Playing,"Aug  4, 2021","Overall, Final Fantasy: Pixel Remaster is a slight disappointment. It isn't a terrible port, but it feels half-hearted. For a game remade and remastered as often as Final Fantasy, it's easy to compare this release to the others and realize that it doesn't have a ton going for it. The updated visuals are nice, and the remastered music is excellent, but otherwise, it's a slightly easier and slightly more user-friendly version of the original NES game. Choose Final Fantasy: Pixel Remaster if you can't play one of the many other versions that have more content."
1645,82,Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster,73,Wccftech,"Aug  9, 2021","The first three Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters are a somewhat solid remastering effort that could have been so much better with a few tweaks. While the amazing rearranged soundtracks sound great and the balancing tweaks make the three games still feel great to play, the divisive overhauled visuals reminiscent of the 16-bit entries, technical issues like the lack of a V-Sync toggle and display settings not saving and lack of additional content found in prior remakes make these remasters a truly worthy purchase only for those who live and breathe Final Fantasy."
1646,82,Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster,70,CD-Action,"Oct 12, 2021","The reinvigorated editions of the first three Final Fantasy games look great, run smoothly and offer some very welcome new features that modern audience expects (e.g. the auto-battle mode and auto-save). The new music arrangements done by Nobuo Uematsu himself are marvelous and the redrawn visuals are vibrant and full of details. Of course, these games are heavily outdated in terms of gameplay and storytelling, so their simplicity might discourage newcomers, but they are still a lot of fun and a great opportunity to experience the revered classics. [10/2021, p.50]"
1647,82,Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster,70,RPG Site,"Jul 29, 2021","I come away from Final Fantasy 1, 2, and 3 looking forward to the remaining games more than I did before. I appreciate the new features like the enhanced bestiary, the auto-combat feature, making grinding friendlier, and I LOVE the new soundtracks. But I hope they manage to address issues like the screen tearing and especially the font before the last three games release."
1648,83,Dreamscaper,88,RPG Fan,"Aug 10, 2021","Dreamscaper has been in early access for about a year, and based on my time with it, I can say that time was well spent by Afterburner. They’ve created a well-balanced and engaging roguelike Action RPG that perfectly pairs with its social simulator mechanics. I continued to play long after I conquered Cassidy’s dreams and enjoyed every run, whether it was all the way to the end of the game or stupidly dying in the first level. This is a super impressive debut for the studio, and I hope that Afterburner is already working on its follow-up title! If Dreamscaper is any indication, we will be in for some sweet dreams ahead!"
1649,83,Dreamscaper,85,Game Informer,"Aug 13, 2021","If you’re an old-time lover of roguelikes that’s into things like Binding of Isaac or Dungeons of Dredmor, Dreamscaper is for you. If you’re a newer addition to the ranks of procedurally-generated dungeon crawls with the new era of roguelites like Rogue Legacy or Hades, Dreamscaper is for you. Either way, smart design decisions and surreal vibes surround the experience, making this an excellent summer surprise."
1650,83,Dreamscaper,82,The Games Machine,"Sep  2, 2021","In a crowded roguelike landscape, Dreamscaper tries to stand out by adding a narrative, advendure-like mini section, which is so well-crafted and interesting that it almost overshadows the action segments. The game offers good graphics and a cool soundtrack, but also repetitive puzzles and unconvincing enemy design. Luckily, the combat system is excellent, which makes a great pick for any action roguelike fan."
1651,83,Dreamscaper,80,CD-Action,"Nov 15, 2021","A roguelike with a strong emphasis on the story. The gameplay turned out to be rather shallow, but the gravity of the subject that the game tackles (depression) makes up for that. For a roguelike, Dreamscaper is quite easy, so its message has a chance to reach a broader audience. [11/2021, p.61]"
1652,83,Dreamscaper,80,Hey Poor Player,"Aug  5, 2021","I appreciated the time I spent with Dreamscaper, and I think Afterburner Studios is a team to watch. That said, the game isn’t as polished yet as I would hope. It’s demanding and very grindy, leaning a bit too much on what I consider Souls mechanics. And given how much time is required to unlock enough features to succeed, I really think the best way to play the game is portably. Sadly, I couldn’t do that on my PC, though it did inspire me to buy a Switch edition shortly before writing this review. But if you’re a fan of rogue and don’t mind a steep challenge, I’d definitely check Dreamscaper out."
1653,83,Dreamscaper,80,RPGamer,"Aug  4, 2021","While the gameplay provides a strong loop that makes it easy to jump in, it’s the immersive atmosphere that grabs hold and keeps players engaged for multiple runs. The emotional struggles of the characters resonate, and there are important messages about how helpful the support of others can be. Reaching its proper conclusion may require more work than is warranted, but the overall experience of Dreamscaper is such that it remains a strong recommendation for those looking for an atmospheric hack-and-slash title."

However, this does come with moments of tedium and monotony, making it best to experience through shorter play sessions. There’s a good balance of subtlety between the character writing and atmosphere with combat’s fast pace and tension. Dreamscaper makes a name for itself in the ever-expansive world of roguelite titles with great detail and nuance."

Games are just as taut and competitive, however, with lots of scope for showboating. No competitive online game in 2021 can be merely a competitive online game, however, and, like Fortnite et al, Knockout City has an entire superstructure of unlockable items and progress meters, with an eye to turning the game into an enduring entertainment platform.

By putting aim aside in favor of feints and co-op, the title from Velan Games offers an exhilarating experience with real personality. Everything loses in clarity once in close combat, of course, but does not spoil the experience for all that. Knockout City is a highly recommendable experience."

There aren’t many games that use dodgeball as a core mechanic, making it somewhat unique, but it feels afraid to take risks, creating an entertaining but ultimately safe experience. If you can gather up some friends, there’s silly enjoyment within and considering it’s got a free trial – to say nothing of Game Pass/EA Play – I’d recommend at least trying it."

I was delighted to see just how much of the original experience remained intact, with the bulk of alterations focused on its visuals and combat. While I am happy that NieR: Automata remains a resounding success, its influence over this updated release of NieR hasn’t robbed it of its unique identity; this is, by and large, the NieR that I fell in love with. I think all the new content that has been added to Replicant ver.1.22 is all worth seeing. Looking back at my journey once more with Nier, Kainé, and Emil, I am so happy that one of the most underappreciated games gets another chance to show why it is so special again."

Ironically, though the game is rendered in an artful monochrome, none of its frequent moral decisions are completely black and white. Every choice had my mouse wavering over the screen, considering the consequences of my actions. It’s one of those rare gaming narratives that’s equally tragic, challenging and exhilarating. The message I felt came across is: don’t weep for the paths not taken or the limited change one person can make, but choose the life you want to live and live it to the fullest. As painful and filled with sorrow as Sir Brante’s life is, it’s one that’s well worth living through yourself."

Each event is sufficiently described with good detail but never overstays its welcome. For the whole fifteen hours!  For this reason, the pacing makes for an addicting experience. Not only is it tight and succinct, but the characters come to life with each dynamic interaction. Everyone has a distinct voice, the world is appropriately harrowing and, as Sir Brante does, players learn how the world works as we become more exposed to it."

I would have loved more interactivity, especially in dialogues, and some decisions seem predetermined and stacked against you a few too many times to truly feel open. In the end, that doesn't detract from the otherwise fun RPG adventure novel.

The powers people wield, the monstrous Others, the mysteries of Red Strings and the deep motivations behind Yuito and Kasane choosing to join the psy-ops in the first place, all these and more await players within Scarlet Nexus."
1718,88,Scarlet Nexus,90,IGN Portugal,"Jul  7, 2021","For less titles like Jump Force and more like Guilty Gear Stive and Scarlet Nexus, with interesting stories that lock you to the screen alongside unique mechanics that fuse the best various genres. It lacks scenery and setting variety, but that goes to a secondary stage with the sheer will of all the other presente elements. An interactive Manga/Anime with bright colors, with dynamic combat that never becomes boring with a daunting and complex tale that is both overwhelming as well as captivating."
1719,88,Scarlet Nexus,90,GamingTrend,"Jun 23, 2021","Scarlet Nexus is an absolute blast from the start and only gets better as you progress. The characters are charming, the story has nice twists and turns, and the combat is simple to understand but hard to master. While it certainly has flaws, this is a must play for action game fans."
1720,88,Scarlet Nexus,88,Game Informer,"Jun 23, 2021","Bandai Namco has crafted something truly strange and quite satisfying with Scarlet Nexus, and I hope we get a slightly more refined sequel."
1721,88,Scarlet Nexus,80,CD-Action,"Sep  1, 2021","Scarlet Nexus is all about combat. The fights are spectacular thanks to vibrant cel-shaded graphics, but primarily because the developers skillfully combined a couple of truly explosive ingredients: agile protagonists with psychokinetic talents, well-designed enemies, and the ability to unleash hell using the powers of your AI-controlled companions. As for the game’s downsides, the environments are repetitive and the writers failed to tie up all the loose ends and left some plot holes. [09/2021, p.54]"
1722,88,Scarlet Nexus,80,Worth Playing,"Jul 23, 2021","Scarlet Nexus is an absolutely solid action-RPG title. The story might get too complicated for its own good, but the characters keep things interesting. Having to revisit the same environments multiple times can get tedious, but the combat is enjoyable throughout due to the new abilities afforded to you by the constant leveling and party member changes. It is a fun romp overall, with enough of a reason to revisit it after completion. Scarlet Nexus is a game that anime fans will thoroughly enjoy."
1723,88,Scarlet Nexus,80,Ragequit.gr,"Jul 21, 2021","Scarlet Nexus has paid a lot of attention to the action part and succeeds very well in delivering an intense, fun, and enjoyable game. If there was a more substantial story, more imagination in the latter stages of the game and more RPG elements, our impressions would be better. However, the hours we spent with it were not wasted at all and it is a worthwhile addition for fans of Japanese action games to their collection."
1724,88,Scarlet Nexus,80,IGN,"Jun 25, 2021","It’s understandable to take a look at Scarlet Nexus and write it off as “just another anime game,” but doing so would be a big mistake. This is an ambitious undertaking from Bandai Namco, one that attempts to blend the two disparate genres of character-action game and large-scale JRPG, and achieves an impressive level of success. Its combat and thin enemy variety don’t hold up all the way to the end of the combined 40 hours of its dual campaigns, but its story and characters absolutely do, and make for a surprise breakout hit of 2021."
1725,88,Scarlet Nexus,80,Merlin'in Kazanı (Turkey),"Jun 23, 2021","With its impressive Brain Punk world, engaging story and action that never gets boring, Scarlet Nexus is a great opportunity for those looking for a new game for Summer."
1726,88,Scarlet Nexus,80,Cubed3,"Jun 23, 2021","Scarlet Nexus blends a unique Brain Punk visual style with tight combat that requires adaptation and synergy. The Others are the game's ace up its sleeve with bizarre but creative creature variety. Each enemy type demands adaptability with the assortment of abilities at Yuito and Kasane's disposal thanks to their squadmates. Outside of combat, character moments shine in Bond Episodes and the writing is complemented well by a talented English voice cast. The variety of personalities does well to carry the weight of the convoluted plot as it progresses. However, the slideshow presentation of the vast majority of cutscenes diminishes the emotional impact of events that would have benefited more from animation. The game provides a solid gameplay experience on PC and I look forward to what this team can come up with next."
1727,88,Scarlet Nexus,80,MGG,"Jun 23, 2021","Scarlet Nexus succeeds in hooking you from the very first minutes. A dense universe coupled with an efficient artistic direction and above all a gameplay that borders on the exceptional, make it a title not to be missed during this summer 2021. Kenji Anabuki, director of the title, offers us a refreshing game with a coherent world on all points, despite the weaknesses that can be the secondary activities or the few environments sometimes too empty. The will to immerse the player in a Shonen is palpable and more than pleasant, as the bet is successful. We can only congratulate and encourage this risk-taking which has more than paid off."
1728,88,Scarlet Nexus,80,PC Invasion,"Jun 23, 2021","Filled to the brim with visual novel conversations and over-the-top action, Scarlet Nexus is a surprisingly endearing game that might be more linear than people expect, but more compelling than it probably needed to be."
1729,88,Scarlet Nexus,80,The Games Machine,"Jun 23, 2021","Scarlet Nexus offers an excellent combat system, paired with creative visual designs and with the courageous choice of having two different (but intertwined) storylines. Unfortunately, a general lack of attention to detail and less-than-impressive environments prevent it from excelling, but it’s definitely a safe choice if you’re into Japanese action RPGs."
1730,88,Scarlet Nexus,80,TheSixthAxis,"Jun 23, 2021","From its compelling story, to its wild enemy designs and combat, I'm kind of in awe of Scarlet Nexus. Where Bandai Namco games often have a niche appeal, I've got no reservations about recommending Scarlet Nexus. I'd definitely suggest skipping a lot of the side stories, but everything else here is the kind of anime-infused greatness that will appeal to nearly everyone."
1731,88,Scarlet Nexus,80,Twinfinite,"Jun 23, 2021","The combat in Scarlet Nexus is no doubt the star of the show. Even when it becomes hard to take the narrative seriously, those sweet, sweet combat mechanics will pull you right back in, no matter which protagonist you choose."
1732,88,Scarlet Nexus,80,Wccftech,"Jun 23, 2021","With masterfully crafted action combat, charming characters, and a very interesting setting, Scarlet Nexus is a game that action RPG fans should definitely not miss. While the game lacks any real innovation, as it features themes and mechanics lifted from other Japanese RPG series, and it is a little too linear, the high quality of the experience makes it easy to look past these few issues, making Scarlet Nexus a memorable, and extremely enjoyable game."

With its nervous and supercharged fights, you quickly become powerful controller in hand, especially when you can borrow the power of your allies on the fly. This action is helped by framerate which does not falter on next-gen consoles despite the deluge of effects on the screen which can cause readability concerns. If the proposed universe is visually attractive, we regret not being able to enjoy it anymore because of a cruel lack of additional content. Ditto for the story which is certainly interesting but which is served by a more than minimalist staging. A good first draft which, we hope, will serve as a solid basis for a more ambitious sequel in the years to come."

1737,88,Scarlet Nexus,70,GameSpot,"Jun 24, 2021","Even though the plot devolves into a trope-filled sludge pool by the end, I don’t feel like Scarlet Nexus was a waste of time. Yes, the excitement of combat begins to taper off towards the end of Scarlet Nexus’s twenty-odd-hour runtime--and the areas in the final stretch of the game feel overly long--but I had a good deal of fun mixing up my SAS abilities, crushing enemies in my Brain Field, and watching my team have a video game tournament at our base to settle an argument over living space boundaries. It might not be a new pinnacle of action-game storytelling, but Scarlet Nexus is still plenty of fun in the right places."
1738,88,Scarlet Nexus,60,PCGamesN,"Jun 25, 2021","Bandai Namco's latest falls disappointingly short outside of the thrills and spills of its excellent battle system, but your mileage may vary depending on your fondness for anime."
1739,88,Scarlet Nexus,50,Hardcore Gamer,"Jun 23, 2021","Who’s to say what the real, developer-side cause is for Scarlet Nexus’ failings. What was already a mammoth undertaking in crafting a competent-enough hack-and-slash action game that could muscle its way into the spotlight, Bandai Namco’s latest in-house creation is not just inadequate in appeasing long-time fans of the genre, but worse, comes across ignorant of its own player’s time."

Overall, an entertaining proposal."
1741,89,LEGO Builder's Journey,82,Impulsegamer,"Jul 16, 2021","Given the price this is sitting at… I don’t know if I can really recommend it. I really need to qualify that though because I think it is absolutely a worthwhile experience, it’s fantastic story telling with stunning visuals. But that about 2 hours I mentioned at the start… that wasn’t just to get a feel for the game… that was to complete the game, from start to finish… about 2 hours. So at this point I’d only really recommend buying the game if it’s on special or if they do in fact add more content (I really hope they do because I’d love to spend more time in this world)."

The neon and candy cane colors, sharp dialogues and flashy action have actually given way to ... serenity. Throughout the game there is no talking, there are no facial expressions and you are not taken by the hand. The soothing soundtrack supports the peaceful nature of the game, and it is wonderful to see how intentions and emotions can be conveyed even without dialogue."

Like sunlight pouring through a window onto countless pieces of Lego on a floor, it gives vision to a world of endless creativity.

1755,90,Time Loader,90,God is a Geek,"Nov  3, 2021",Time Loader is a great physics-based puzzler with a ton of heart that grips you emotionally throughout and refuses to let go.
1756,90,Time Loader,90,Hey Poor Player,"Nov  3, 2021","Even though the story serves as yet another example of why one shouldn’t trifle with time travel, the fun involved makes turning the clock back to 1995 seem pretty enticing. From solid physics to flawlessly detailed environments, Time Loader takes the player on a wild ride through the past and launches the neglected 2D puzzle-platformer genre into the future like a speeding DeLorean leaving flame trails in its wake."
1757,90,Time Loader,85,GameSpace,"Nov  3, 2021","Time Loader features a beautifully created complex world with a variety of well-constructed paths, puzzles and riddles presented to players from the point of view of a tiny robotic car. Even seemingly mundane things take on new interesting forms during the game. Seemingly trivial things can be used in creative ways during the playthrough and even force you to reconsider your attitude towards the surroundings and the story at large."
1758,90,Time Loader,80,PC Invasion,"Nov  3, 2021","A well made game with a great premise and enjoyable elements, Time Loader is well worth a playthrough for fans of puzzle platformers."
1759,90,Time Loader,70,Screen Rant,"Nov  3, 2021","Despite a few shortcomings, over the course of a playthrough, Time Loader proves itself to be a game worth trying out for those interested in its concept. The story is smart and, in true time travel fashion, has multiple ways in which it can come to a close. All of this is presented alongside a solid gameplay core which makes for a fun, if short, jaunt through a sci-fi tale."
1760,90,Time Loader,50,KeenGamer,"Nov  4, 2021","Ultimately, Time Loader is a beautiful-looking, wonderful-sounding game, with some fun gameplay. It's let down by a story that focuses on a character without making them engaging, the lack of challenge that comes with the puzzles, and everything being in service of the game's least engaging aspect. It is unfortunately quite a short game as well. My initial run-through clocked in at about 2.6 hours. So a recommendation here is really based on what you want for your money. If you're fine with slightly un-challenging, hand-holdy at times gameplay and a story that looks pretty but doesn't go anywhere, pick it up! If you want a little more bang for your buck, maybe wait it out to see if Flazm adds anything interesting. Honestly, this game has a lot of potential to be good, if they just rework the story and maybe add some challenge levels."

1765,91,Gloomhaven,85,IGN Italia,"Oct 13, 2021",An excellent digital version of a very good boardgame. Good for both veterans of the tabletop version (due to new content like the Guildmaster campaign) and newbies willing to try a peculiar fantasy experience (and manage a lot of cards).

1768,91,Gloomhaven,80,The Indie Game Website,"Oct 15, 2021","At its core, Gloomhaven is a deep tactical experience that’s immensely satisfying once you get to grips with its layers upon layers of systems. It also includes multiple options to vary the difficulty, so newer players don’t feel overly punished by making mistakes, whilst strategy aficionados can dial up the challenge to match their ability."
1769,91,Gloomhaven,75,GameCritics,"Nov 15, 2021","Although I was far from mastering the techniques and rules of Gloomhaven after my time with it for review, I do commend Flaming Fowl for a job well done. They have delivered a well-curated digital version of an extremely complex and intimidating tabletop experience — fans of the original or those curious to dip a toe in without breaking the bank should check it out."
1770,91,Gloomhaven,70,Digitally Downloaded,"Nov 11, 2021","That aside, Asmodee continues to demonstrate why it is the best digital board game developer going around. Gloomhaven itself is a little insular compared to the likes of Game of Thrones, Arkham Horror, Ticket to Ride, Pathfinder and Lord of the Rings, so I suspect it will appeal to a narrower band of players than some of Asmodee's other adaptations, but the faithful quality of that adaptation and the stellar production values make it an easy sell to existing Gloomhaven fans, and the ideal way to those that were intimidated by the size (and cost) of the box when they've seen it in their local game store to give it a go in the first place."
1771,91,Gloomhaven,70,RPGamer,"Oct 18, 2021","Gloomhaven offers hours of mental challenges with a sophisticated battle system. It is based on a board game but tries to go beyond that. Those already attracted to the idea of Gloomhaven can have it here for less assembly and with an additional Guildmaster mode. Since this digital version becomes tiresome after a while because the vast number of missions ultimately feel repetitive, it’s better to play in small doses. The game is recommendable, but probably playing it online with friends in co-op mode is closer to the original’s experience."
1772,91,Gloomhaven,50,Eurogamer Italy,"Nov 22, 2021","Gloomhaven tries to bring the experience of the board game on our screens, but fails to recreate the feel of being around a table. The game, although very loyal to the source, lacks pacing and the missions (very repetitive after a while), even at the lowest levels, are incredibly hard and for the most part frustrating. It is definitely overwhelming for a new player, and way too much relying on RNG for a good result. A good opportunity that sadly doesn’t really deliver."

This is a game to relax with, where the destination is as picture-perfect as the journey."
1776,92,TOEM,83,RPG Fan,"Sep 13, 2021","A casual speedrun to just get to the end will run about two hours, but if TOEM is played how it’s “intended,” then expect to get a few hours out of it, while completionists might hit five or more. If content’s your concern, there it is, but if a high-quality, easygoing experience to escape the anxiety of these pandemic times—or whatever ails you—then TOEM works wonders. The world needs more TOEM, and it’s been a pleasure to get to live in this meditative place, even if only for a short while."

Very short and accessible, the title of Something We Made is undoubtedly what you need if you want to indulge in a peaceful experience, populated by characters as absurd as they are amusing. It doesn't go any further than that, doesn't pretend to, and that is undoubtedly very good."

With a camera and a diorama-like stage design, the adventure progresses slowly; you choose the pace and which tasks to complete. It is a contemplative title that seeks to manifest human good deeds and solidarity. Despite not taking advantage of the potential of its world to tell a good story and some far-fetched tasks, the result is more than remarkable. More than recommended."
1785,93,The Eternal Cylinder,95,GameCritics,"Oct 21, 2021","This title is full of new ideas, design that is coherent with its larger ideas and it offers an attempt to draw attention to real-life subjects such as social diversity, just like a true work of art. Taken in total, The Eternal Cylinder is an unforgettable experience."
1786,93,The Eternal Cylinder,95,PC Invasion,"Oct  1, 2021","The Eternal Cylinder is a gorgeous adventure game that features one of the most compelling stories I've seen in years. Its strict linearity may be frustrating for some, but that slight downside is vastly outweighed by this game's many strengths."
1787,93,The Eternal Cylinder,90,Softpedia,"Oct 12, 2021","The Eternal Cylinder has a cool story, interesting exploration mechanics, a good unique idea in the mutations, and solid presentation. While it starts off a little slow, once it gets going it kept me engaged and pushing forward. The trebhums might be too cute for their own good but it’s nice to see how they solve puzzles via mutations while navigating their cylinder threatened planet.
ACE Team has specialized in weird worlds, but this is the first time the studio has managed to craft one that is also beautiful and immersive. Sometimes I wanted the gameplay spaces to be a little bigger, or even entirely open world. But I understand that The Eternal Cylinder needs structure and hope that the easy-to-understand mechanics and cute protagonists will allow a wide range of players to engage with the game."
1788,93,The Eternal Cylinder,90,COGconnected,"Oct  5, 2021","The world of The Eternal Cylinder is the most imaginative surrealist representation I’ve seen to date. You’ll be shaking your head in wonder at just how the hell anyone was able to think up such a design for a creature that just skids across the water. Or the giant floating monsters that want to sit on you. It’s a boon that the gameplay holds up as well and if you ever find it too challenging, it’s easy to turn down various settings to let you sit back and immerse yourself in something you won’t be able to easily describe to your friends. And the longer you play you’ll wonder why more games aren’t this creative in all aspects. I really enjoyed my time guiding my flock of Trebhum from danger to salvation. And I hope you will too. Just remember to roll like you didn’t know you could."
1789,93,The Eternal Cylinder,80,Hardcore Gamer,"Sep 30, 2021","For all the team’s expertise on the weird, the fact that this visual identity is far from the intended appeal should give you an idea at just how well the mechanics and overall reaction to such interlocking systems plays out. Most of which left to the player’s own imagination with how best to utilize said tools and similarly-spoken scenarios. But not for a second do ACE Team view an otherwise absence of comprehension as an automatic fail-state. Yet at the same time, managing to burrow enough of a temptation that failure in that regard will almost always be by the player’s own curious, sometimes greedy, hand. That level of confidence but more so lenience in its concept — an understanding on when and how survival mechanics can be implemented without feeling tedious or invasive — in the end is what makes The Eternal Cylinder as fascinating an adventure to decipher as it is to watch unfold with bated breath."

1791,93,The Eternal Cylinder,70,Screen Rant,"Oct 21, 2021","This chase-and-reprieve dynamic makes for a well-paced campaign which should take most players 12 hours or so to complete. The Eternal Cylinder makes for a tricky game to conveniently classify, and the mix of survival, exploration, platforming, puzzle, and action elements does sometimes collide with its clumsy and slippery controls. Adjustable difficulty settings are welcoming, but even on default mode there’s a generosity of checkpointing and saves, and rarely is an attempt punished too harshly; plus, when the permanent mutation system is later unlocked, it feels practically game-breaking. Warts and all, The Eternal Cylinder remains an accessible oddball adventure of one-of-a-kind sights."

1793,94,Ocean's Heart,90,The Indie Game Website,"Jan 21, 2021","The number of quests and hidden places to unveil shows up the amount of dedication and attention to detail instilled in the project, with every sidequest expanding and adding information to the lore of the game without feeling tedious at all no matter how long you take to traverse these vast lands. Whether you rescue your loved ones, talk to consumed gods or just kill Leshys, whatever path you travel will have hours of fun ahead, while you try to find the Ocean’s Heart."
1794,94,Ocean's Heart,89,RPG Fan,"Mar 15, 2021","Speedrunners will likely delight in ripping through this game, while others will enjoy a leisurely adventure as they poke into every inch of the world plumbing for secrets. A magical adventure tinged with nostalgia can be hard to find these days, but Ocean’s Heart delivers a stellar, fun experience that may leave you craving more."
1795,94,Ocean's Heart,85,Softpedia,"Jan 22, 2021","Ocean’s Heart is a good game with a specific audience in mind. The overall atmosphere and the presentation will capture the attention of anyone who has had even a casual relationship with the classic Zelda releases. But the game has more to offer than a simple homage and adds humor, cool levels, solid combat, and a quirky look that make it unique. Using the sword, bows, and bombs to get through enemies and puzzles is simple and engaging throughout. There are moments when the difficulty spikes a little too harshly but that’s compensated by the simple continue system. The map can be unhelpful and the borders between spaces a little hard to always detect. But Max Mraz knows how to make the player feel welcomed inside the world he builds and I cannot wait to see what he can deliver next, after Yarntown and Ocean’s Heart."
1796,94,Ocean's Heart,80,Shindig,"Mar 10, 2021","Ocean’s Heart is a game that clearly comes from a place of deep affection for the classic Legend of Zelda games, and it does a fine job of channeling those.

1797,94,Ocean's Heart,80,GameOver.gr,"Feb 19, 2021","A 2D Zelda clone with a large, charming world full of secrets that unfortunately is not on par with the series that it copies, but can surely offer a great experience to Zelda fans."
1798,94,Ocean's Heart,80,TheSixthAxis,"Jan 21, 2021","In the great pantheon of top-down 2D Zelda-alikes, Ocean's Heart is right up there with the lovely Blossom Tales. The world is well designed, the items and abilities are perfectly judged and it is aware enough of its influences to feel like a loving tribute rather than a cynical clone. Combine this with some nicely written dialogue and you have a winning formula. A great remedy for the January blues and a nostalgic trip back in time."
1799,94,Ocean's Heart,80,Gamer Escape,"Jan 21, 2021","Ocean’s Heart is a love letter to its genre, and I feel like it’s one that does it justice. I really enjoyed this game and all it had to offer. The main story, as well as the side-quests, keep you interested and immersed in the world you’re exploring, the visuals are full of color and charm, and the gameplay, while basic, is elevated by constant puzzle-solving and exploration, making it harder to get bored. If you have it in you to ignore the clunky controls (which I did) then you will find a lot to enjoy about this game."

It is a breeze to play, but if the controls weren’t always so precise, it would be easy to fully immerse in this archipelago and see where the tides take Tilia.  Combat is simple but fun, puzzles are in the same boat, and the game puts an emphasis on exploration and adventure with an easy-learning curve.  Jumping in to the game to sail the seas searching for the next upgrade and for clues to what happened to Tilia’s family is an interconnected and wholesome endeavor, leaving the player plenty to enjoy and experience."
1802,94,Ocean's Heart,70,GameSkinny,"Jan 21, 2021","Ocean’s Heart is a charming, albeit uninspired, Zelda-like 2D adventure that wears its influences a bit too heavily. Despite that, Ocean’s Heart would feel right at home on SNES, featuring a lovely 16-bit pixel art style that really shines through. Old-school Zelda fans will likely enjoy it and as a retro-styled RPG, it still comes recommended despite these flaws."

1808,95,Hell Let Loose,82,COGconnected,"Jul 29, 2021","Not every game or genre needs to appeal to every gamer. Hell Let Loose is built for hardcore multiplayer shooter fans with a desire to move away from the casual and sometimes irrelevant teamwork that makes easier games well, easier. Hell Let Loose demands commitment, cooperation, and enough patience to learn the game through several hours of painful, frequent death and have a genuine willingness to contribute to a squad instead of being a lone hero. Meet these requirements and you’re in for a singular and memorable battlefield simulation."
1809,95,Hell Let Loose,80,Games.cz,"Aug 16, 2021","Hell Let Loose stands somewhere in the middle between truly authentic WWII shooters and their more casual-leaning counterparts. It’s not without faults, but the team behind it works tirelessly to expunge them all."
1810,95,Hell Let Loose,80,Screen Rant,"Jul 26, 2021","If players are looking for a quick fix of World War Two shooting action, then Hell Let Loose won't be for them.  The pace, length, and harsh combat conditions dictate that players dedicate themselves to teamwork and victory. If players are willing to communicate over voice, work together to achieve local and broader objectives, and have the patience to play slowly, Hell Let Loose can be amazing. It may not happen every session, but a full game of Hell Let Loose with a dedicated, communicative teams is a must-experience gaming moment for any fans of tactical shooters."
1811,95,Hell Let Loose,80,NME,"Jul 26, 2021","Despite a very challenging start to the game, Hell Let Loose delivers a near-unparalleled experience as a gritty, hardcore WW2 shooter.

1812,95,Hell Let Loose,75,Everyeye.it,"Aug  3, 2021","Hell Let Loose is not a game for everyone and it is very likely that those looking only for a shooter set in the Second World War may not appreciate it. It is in fact a product designed exclusively for a hardcore audience that is not afraid of the long times that elapse between one death and another and that cannot be categorized as a simple first-person shooter. Hell Let Loose is an experience that aims to recreate situations as similar as possible to those of a real conflict and this involves a slow and reasoned approach that is in stark contrast to other modern productions, which focus everything on immediacy and chaos. If you're ready to turn a blind eye to some annoying glitches and that's the kind of simulation you're looking for, then you might find hours and hours of fun with your most trusted teammates in Hell Let Loose."
1813,95,Hell Let Loose,75,GameSpace,"Aug  3, 2021","Now, getting to the main question that you would probably ask: “Is Hell Let Loose worth the price?” Well, it depends. If you are a patient gamer against minor bugs and issues, and you love hardcore games, then you should get it. On the other hand, if you think you might not like the realism of the game or you don’t have any squads, then you’d better wait for a free weekend opportunity or a discount on the price."

Though it’s very easy to get discouraged at the beginning, those committed to seeing it through will likely have a great time.

Yes, while it would’ve been nice that all the DLC was just baked into the base game, but it’s a small price to pay to be able to recruit demons on the go, or not have to worry about losing access to the title if a digital storefront shutters (I mean Steam will never close…will it?). Don’t make the 16 year mistake I did by letting this one pass you by."
1817,96,Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster,85,Hooked Gamers,"Jun  1, 2021","All in all SMT III is a tricky game to review, particularly without comparing it to the Persona series that gamers may be more acquainted with, especially on Steam. The concepts and designs of demons are very clearly the same, but the combat and story play out in such different ways, not even including the lack of the social sim portion that Persona is known for. If you’re a fan of JRPGS or played SMT III on the PS2, then this reviewer recommends looking into the dark story of the Demifiend and what becomes of the world around him."
1818,96,Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster,85,Game Revolution,"May 18, 2021","For me, Shin Megami Tensei 3: Nocturne HD Remaster is worth the premium, if only because I hope it encourages Sega and Atlus to remaster more of their catalogs (Panzer Dragoon Saga, please). However, players who think they’re going to find another Persona here will be disappointed. Nocturne is one of the great traditional JRPGs, but potential buyers should know what they’re getting into before they pull the trigger."
1819,96,Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster,85,GamingTrend,"May 18, 2021","Shin Megami Tensei III Nocturne HD Remaster is a fantastic game at its core, but does little to justify the HD Remaster part of its title. The visuals are improved greatly and being able to choose between Raidou and Dante is nice, but there are few improvements the base game desperately needed like better dungeon design."
1820,96,Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster,85,The Mako Reactor,"May 18, 2021","While Nocturne itself is a masterpiece that deserved better in a lot of ways, Shin Megami Tensei III Nocturne HD Remaster is well worth experiencing with its sublime combat, great characters, amazing atmosphere, and memorable boss fights."
1821,96,Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster,80,DarkZero,"Jun 15, 2021","This is a minimal remastered release of a great cult Japanese RPG that still has a distinct story, setting and theme, with entertaining and challenging combat. It might be a bit too old school for some, but for fans or people who want to flesh out the Atlus RPG catalogue and see some of their history, then they will get to experience a special mature JRPG that holds up through its strong core mechanics. It is just a bummer that more has not been done with the remaster treatment, as this game deserves to be treated with more love."

1823,96,Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster,80,RPG Site,"May 18, 2021","Despite some glaring flaws around the edges, Shin Megami Tensei III Nocturne HD Remaster is still a decently updated release of one of my favorite RPGs of all time. Much of that is attributed to the strength of the original core game experience, though. In the context of 2021, Nocturne HD Remaster almost feels like the student that does the bare minimum in class to get a passing grade. When I look around and see these great re-releases of SaGa Frontier Remastered, NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139…, and the work put in for the first Mass Effect in the very recent Legendary Edition, I wish that this re-release of Nocturne was able to finally rectify some of its long-standing problems - especially the audio compression during combat. I also think about the outstanding work Atlus put in for last year’s Steam release of Persona 4 Golden and how this feels lackluster even compared to that. I still quite enjoyed my time with Nocturne HD Remaster, but it is great because the core game is already phenomenal; aside from adding skill inheritance to demon fusions, most of the updates in this remaster aren’t all that remarkable."

If some additions make the experience more pleasant, such as the presence of a dub, we regret that this release does not take the opportunity to offer a more accessible experience to a new audience. Despite everything, 16 years later, SMT III retains its period charm and will keep Atlus fans waiting before the release of the fifth episode scheduled for this year."

Nocturne is unabashedly old-school, in both good ways and not-so-great ways. The gameplay adjustments and options allow for decent customization of the experience, but some of the omissions in this re-release are pretty glaring. It's not perfect, but so long as players can adjust to its rustic edges, there is a fantastic old-school JRPG in Nocturne's remaster full of quality of life changes that make it worth playing in 2021."
1827,96,Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster,70,PC Games,"May 18, 2021","Measured against current games, SMT 3 simply cannot keep up here. I would recommend the remaster to fans of the series. Everyone else should think twice about getting the game, especially considering the high price."
1828,96,Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster,60,MGG,"May 18, 2021","Despite all the love we have for the original material, it is unfortunately impossible for us to recommend this remaster of Shin Megami Tensei 3 at full price. If some efforts have been made to make the experience much more accessible, the graphical lifting is almost non-existent. The game still has great qualities, with its unique universe and its very strategic monsters fights, but we can only advise you to wait for the price to go down a notch before trying the experience."
1829,97,The Vale: Shadow of the Crown,93,RPG Fan,"Aug 31, 2021","This is a title that not only allows people sometimes unable to experience gaming a chance to do so, but it also provides an incredibly unique immersion experience and a different perspective to sighted gamers. A solid, engaging RPG lies at the heart of The Vale: Shadow of the Crown, one that proves to be a truly insightful experience for those who can play it."

1832,97,The Vale: Shadow of the Crown,80,RPGamer,"Aug 19, 2021","The Vale offers a unique and touching experience in which sighted players will learn the unique abilities of blind people and how they “see” the world. Just as the princess encourages her companion to help as many people as they can, the game itself encourages mainstream games to make themselves more accessible to people who need assistance. The Vale: Shadow of the Crown appreciably widens the definition of video games and is not only a very welcome boon for blind and low-vision gamers, but a worthwhile title for those who seek a fresh and unique gaming experience. So close your eyes and use your ears to understand your surroundings because this game is absolutely worth the time."
1833,97,The Vale: Shadow of the Crown,80,TheGamer,"Aug 19, 2021","So much of what The Vale does feels like a reinvention of the video game wheel, and not always out of simple necessity. I think the developers at Falling Squirrel are visionaries, and I can’t wait to see what they do next with everything they’ve learned about game design while making The Vale. This is a fully blind accessible game, but that doesn’t at all mean it's an experience only the visually impaired would enjoy. There’s nothing lesser or limited about The Vale. It’s a fully realized experience that could only work in an audio space, and I sincerely believe it's going to inspire a lot of people to reexamine their beliefs about what a game has to do or be. If this is the beginning of indie audio games, I can’t wait to see where the genre goes from here."
1834,97,The Vale: Shadow of the Crown,80,Screen Rant,"Aug 19, 2021","The concept behind The Vale: Shadow of the Crown is so simple and genius that it's a wonder that it has never been done before - though it's worth noting that this iteration is done incredibly well, gracefully sidestepping many of the potential pitfalls of its conceit. The combat has a few frustrations that could use some ironing out, but they don't detract from what is a compelling and unique video game experience."
1835,97,The Vale: Shadow of the Crown,77,KeenGamer,"Aug 31, 2021","The Vale: Shadow of the Crown is an incredibly well-made experience for all kinds of players itching for a different kind of adventure. The writing of the world as you traverse it through Alex's shoes is fleshed-out and atmospheric. While the plot itself isn't unique, the design touches still allowed the world to become alive. The audio-based combat is challenging enough to make you use your brain as you listen for cues, without frustration. This is a game for those who want a new kind of narrative role-playing adventure and challenge, where you rely on your hearing, perception, and wits."
1836,97,The Vale: Shadow of the Crown,70,Riot Pixels,"Oct 17, 2021","The Vale puts binaural sounds and simple controls to good use, but the repetitive combat and copy/pasted towns quickly get old. This adventure is good for exactly one playthrough, and that’s it."
1837,97,The Vale: Shadow of the Crown,70,The Indie Game Website,"Aug 23, 2021","The Vale is very much an experience, and it’s one I found interesting, even if it felt a little frustrating at times. The truth is, there just aren’t many games like this, and The Vale’s innovative take on accessible gameplay made it worth overlooking its flaws. It’s not perfect, but it’s interesting, and I’ll choose that over perfect every time."
1838,98,Final Fantasy III Pixel Remaster,90,Gamer Escape,"Aug  5, 2021","The biggest impediment to recommending these games to others is just the fact that, well… in many ways they are slight things. None of these games are terribly long if you know what you’re doing, nor are they tremendously difficult. The stories are not super compelling on their own. They are little games in a way, and they are definitely aged. But if you loved these games before, these remasters are perfect for what they’re trying to do. They’re charming. They feel like a sudden rush of nostalgia not because they’re exactly the games you remember, but the rare form of remaster that does add some stuff on top while still preserving all of the spirit and intent perfectly. And if you’ve never played these games but want to understand why people loved them so much, these are the perfect way to try them out."

1842,98,Final Fantasy III Pixel Remaster,80,Worth Playing,"Aug  4, 2021","Final Fantasy III: Pixel Remaster is the best version of the game to date. It feels more modern and polished than the NES version, and it lacks some of the annoying foibles and flaws of the 3D version. It's still a dated JRPG, but with the Pixel Remaster, it feels a lot easier to pick up and play. I had previously said that FF3 was my least favorite of the NES trilogy, but I enjoyed this title the most in the three Pixel Remaster offerings. If you're only going to get one of the Pixel Remaster titles, then FF3PR is the one to get."
1843,98,Final Fantasy III Pixel Remaster,80,RPG Fan,"Jul 30, 2021","Ultimately, if I was going to recommend one NES-era Final Fantasy to anyone, it would be Final Fantasy III. You can feel the sheer genre-pushing joy on screen as you play. This version of Final Fantasy III removes many of the original’s frustrating elements, but it still feels like an RPG of its era, for good or ill. The job system might not be that complex, the story might not be that engaging, and the exploration might be frustrating. But without this game bridging the gap between the early era and the SNES, we wouldn’t have gotten to Square’s golden age. It’s worth playing for that reason alone."
1844,98,Final Fantasy III Pixel Remaster,80,Hardcore Gamer,"Jul 29, 2021","The improved approach to storytelling and world building that gave the world a personality in Final Fantasy II continues with this entry as well. Final Fantasy III is where the series seems to have become established in its identity. One of the most notable recurring observations while playing Final Fantasy III Pixel Remaster is the early signs of what we would see after Final Fantasy transitions to the 16-bit generations, but comparisons to its successors aside, Final Fantasy III exemplifies what a great RPG looked like thirty years ago."
1845,98,Final Fantasy III Pixel Remaster,73,Wccftech,"Aug  9, 2021","The first three Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters are a somewhat solid remastering effort that could have been so much better with a few tweaks. While the amazing rearranged soundtracks sound great and the balancing tweaks make the three games still feel great to play, the divisive overhauled visuals reminiscent of the 16-bit entries, technical issues like the lack of a V-Sync toggle and display settings not saving and lack of additional content found in prior remakes make these remasters a truly worthy purchase only for those who live and breathe Final Fantasy."

1847,98,Final Fantasy III Pixel Remaster,70,Siliconera,"Jul 28, 2021","Final Fantasy III Pixel Remaster is an opportunity to play through a missing piece of the series’ history. Some of its concepts might be a bit antiquated, but it’s amazing to essentially have a prettier version of a video game time capsule to finally peruse and learn from. While the UI has some issues, Square Enix did a great job of restoring and bringing this game to audiences that have spent a long time waiting for it."
1848,99,Wolfstride,95,Softpedia,"Dec  9, 2021","Wolfstride is an obvious labor of love that manages to be much more than the sum of its gameplay and presentation parts. The mecha battles and management would have offered a very solid loop on their own. The game could have easily been a mostly narrative-driven game with a relatively small number of repetitive mini-games. The combination of both creates an emotionally charged adventure that immerses the player, makes him care about relationships, and drops in cool mechs engagements. Think of it as heavily inspired by Cowboy Bebop but with more mech brawls."
1849,99,Wolfstride,90,Noisy Pixel,"Dec  7, 2021","Wolfstride is a stylish RPG for people who love the atmosphere from old-school anime such as Cowboy Bebop, Ashita no Joe, and its recent-ish spin-off Megalobox. Its story goes from unabashedly comedic to dramatic in a heartbeat and manages to remain consistently compelling. While the gameplay could have offered further variety, this is one title where the story and atmosphere are enough to make it resonate with practically any audience."
1850,99,Wolfstride,85,COGconnected,"Dec 10, 2021","Wolfstride might have gotten off to a rough start, but I think if you go into it knowing that it’s a story-forward game, you’ll enjoy it quite a bit. I ended up liking the game way more than I thought possible. It kept surprising me. It hooked me with its style, then its humor, and when I thought I knew everything, it showed me its heart. For only $18 CAD, Wolfstride has my strongest recommendation."
1851,99,Wolfstride,80,GameCritics,"Jan 28, 2022","Because this game oozes love for mecha anime and RPGs without falling into being merely referential or nostalgic, Wolfstride is its own beast — a zany, at times heartfelt tale built atop a solid gameplay foundation of meeting giant robots and punching them in the face."
1852,99,Wolfstride,80,The Indie Game Website,"Dec 16, 2021","All in all, Wolfstride demonstrates how great a game can be when the characters in it are full of personality, and also succeeds in presenting a combat system that’s fun and challenging, without losing simplicity. Its characters are a bunch of lovely, lowly criminals that conduct themselves kind of aimlessly through life, failing upwards more than progressing, and perhaps, under all that rubbish you can find actually nice people with complex minds and even more complicated lives. But of course, Wolfstride is, first and foremost, a game about mechas demolishing each other, and the game never lets you forget it."
1853,99,Wolfstride,70,Hardcore Gamer,"Dec  9, 2021","Wolfstride has its flaws, but if you’re willing to get past them, it ends up having a unique charm in its story, characters and combat that’s worth checking out. Sure, the giant anime mech battles may be a main draw, but you’ll stay for the clever bits of character development and glimpses into the history and personalities of these rascals as you get to know them. Wolfstride doesn’t always land with a huge mechanical blow, but it can still deliver a decent hit overall."
1854,99,Wolfstride,70,PC Invasion,"Dec  7, 2021","Wolfstride is an enjoyable anime-like mech fighting adventure with an interesting cast of characters. Other than the slow start, it's easy to ignore the parts that fall short."
1855,99,Wolfstride,60,NME,"Dec  9, 2021","Pacing issues and some, uh, highly subjective humour aside, Wolfstride is a pleasingly original, sharply animated and silly JRPG tribute. Go in with some patience, and it’ll eventually be rewarded with an infectious mecha-battler with heart and style."
1856,100,Crysis Remastered Trilogy,85,Noisy Pixel,"Oct 20, 2021","Crysis Remastered Trilogy offers a memorable single-player FPS experience that every fan of the genre should play. Although modern gamers may only recognize the name from a meme shared by older PC nerds, it gives everyone a chance to play these games on modern hardware with optimized visuals. I feel like this was a needed release from developer Crytek. I hope they can muster up a follow-up that retains this single-player experience because this gaming generation needs it."
1857,100,Crysis Remastered Trilogy,82,The Games Machine,"Oct 15, 2021",The Crysis Remastered Trilogy gives new life to three outstanding shooters of the recent past.
1858,100,Crysis Remastered Trilogy,80,DarkZero,"Dec  6, 2021","Crysis Remastered Trilogy offers a great insight into the series’ shift in design, from the experimental freedom of Crysis to the linear campaign of Crysis 2. This Trilogy Remastered collection allows the games to be at their visually best and are able to run better now thanks to advancements in PC hardware. Anyone looking for some slick first-person shooting action will most likely enjoy this. Even if new people do not like the now clunkiness of Crysis, they will likely enjoy the polished controls and gameplay of Crysis 2 and Crysis 3. It is a shame the multiplayer modes or the editors are not included, as that would have made this the perfect package, but for everything else, this is a worthwhile collection of some of the PC’s most fascinating sci-fi action shooters."
1859,100,Crysis Remastered Trilogy,80,PC Games,"Oct 21, 2021","The three Crysis games still look great on modern PCs and are a lot fun, which raises the question if we really needed these remasters in the first place. The first Crysis Remastered is somewhat of a mixed bag, in some regards better, in others subpar to the amazing PC original. Crysis 2 however looks noticably crisper with some nice visual touches like raytraced reflections, sharper textures and improved lighting. The third remaster received less attention in comparison, up to a point where one might ask if a simple patch would have sufficed. Which brings us to the consoles, because this is where the three remasters really shine: No matter on which plattform you play, the console versions are greatly improved with smoother framerates and sharper image quality that outshines the original Xbox 360 and PS3 releases in every possible way."
1860,100,Crysis Remastered Trilogy,80,Shacknews,"Oct 21, 2021",Some movies work better in theaters. Some games work better on bleeding-edge hardware.

1862,100,Crysis Remastered Trilogy,80,Multiplayer.it,"Oct 18, 2021","Crysis Remastered Trilogy is an excellent collection as a whole, which allows you to play the three chapters that make up the series with more modern graphics, capable of taking advantage of even the most performing video cards. Of course, it is interesting to note how you start with an excellent title (Crysis), moving on to a decent one and nothing more (Crysis 2) to get to a really great one (Crysis 3), but honestly we do not recommend you to sacrifice any of the three (they are can also be purchased individually) in case you decide to take the trilogy, because in any case they form a unique story, which is worth living in full, once you are inside. It must also be said that the experience as a whole remains identical to that of the originals, so those who have already lived it will not find great incentives to do it again, apart from the graphic ones."
1863,100,Crysis Remastered Trilogy,75,Jeuxvideo.com,"Oct 28, 2021","Crytek has really worked hard to enhance the graphical experience of the various games, especially on PCs where the Windows version can rely on a few features, such as ray-tracing, which give a real boost. The environments are drastically improved and despite the sometimes difficult optimization, the rendering is very good. As for the Crysis themselves, it is clear that a number of mechanisms are now aging: they remain good titles, but never speak of excellence ... It's up to you to see what you are looking for."
1864,100,Crysis Remastered Trilogy,75,Worth Playing,"Oct 22, 2021","The work done on Crysis 2 and 3 makes the Crysis Remastered Trilogy a better proposition than the first game alone. The more stable frame rate and presence of DLSS right out of the box provides a much better first impression compared to the unstable frame rate of the first game; the ray tracing is equally impressive yet flawed. The gunplay feels tighter in these entries, but newcomers may be more disappointed in seeing how the game constrains itself with each subsequent entry. There's still room for improvement, but the whole thing feels like a safer purchase for those who want to experience some good games with minor updates."
1865,100,Crysis Remastered Trilogy,70,Checkpoint Gaming,"Nov 17, 2021","Crysis Remastered Trilogy is a collection of games that is a hell of a lot of fun and really is an important moment in video game history. For a while there, it was the benchmark for graphics in games, and it’s important that games like this are preserved and released in their remastered form not just on PC but for modern consoles as well. It’s a bundle for those who love their games to look gorgeous, have the autonomy to blow up stuff in a number of different and creative ways, and love FPS vibes. With all three games remastered and in one collection, Crysis Remastered Trilogy is a lot of big bangs for your buck, despite some shortfalls."

Golf Club Wasteland is using nonlinear storytelling to a great extent and it is a truly amazing experience."

1868,101,Golf Club: Wasteland,85,Softpedia,"Sep 13, 2021","Golf Club: Wasteland is a good game but not because of the quality of its actual golfing experience. Putting balls into holes is serviceable. There are some well-designed levels but there are also some frustrating ones. Don’t feel any guilt if you play on Story mode and get as much of the narrative as you can, without bothering with hazards or limits. But the developers at Demagog understand how to create atmosphere and how to let the world tell a story. Radio Nostalgia is an impressive achievement, especially the songs. The team does need to find a game theme and a set of mechanics that allows them to flex their world-building muscles in more expansive ways than Golf Club: Wasteland can."
1869,101,Golf Club: Wasteland,85,Multiplayer.it,"Sep  3, 2021","If you are in search of a good golf game, leave it be, but if you want a good story, you will find one of the most significant games of the year."

In particular, we get an impeccable soundtrack, intelligently alternating between musics and precious testimonials for the scenario context. And if the adventure is short, it is given good replayability."
1872,101,Golf Club: Wasteland,75,The Indie Game Website,"Sep  3, 2021","In the end, however, Golf Club Wasteland didn’t need to sell me on its main character for it to work. It tells more than a story about one person or one moment. Instead, its strength is in the world it creates, the microstories of each level, and the layers of social critique in each part of its radio broadcasts. The rich will watch the world burn and complain about the glare―best make sure that golf course is shady."
1873,101,Golf Club: Wasteland,72,IGN Italia,"Sep  2, 2021","Golf Club: Wasteland is a super stylish puzzle-golf game which works better as an interactive drama than a golf game. The shooting system is shallow and brings into the experience too much ""trial and error"", but the atmosphere, the radio sounds and Charley's meaningful story give a melanchonic and charming dimension to the game."
1874,101,Golf Club: Wasteland,70,CD-Action,"Jan 19, 2022","It could have been a relaxing game about playing golf on the ruins of our civilization, but its whole sporting aspect is subpar (due to poor physics, among others), sometimes frustrating, and makes it harder to appreciate the story. However, Golf Club: Wasteland definitely has its unique flavor and the in-game radio station is fantastic. [12/2021, p.67]"
1875,101,Golf Club: Wasteland,60,Checkpoint Gaming,"Sep  2, 2021","Golf Club: Wasteland is a rather standard golf game bolstered by an experimental narrative approach. This iteration is, have no doubt, an improvement on the niche ideas therein, and for that, I applaud the developers. However, good as these ideas are, they suffer from feeling incompatible with each other. Everything is OK, with the distinct sting of feeling like they could have been great, given the right conditions."

1877,102,Road 96,100,NME,"Aug 16, 2021","Road 96 expertly replicates the thrills and trepidations of classic road trip stories. Its most obvious strength is its unpredictability, which comes from a combination of randomly arranged scenes, eclectic characters and unexpected mini-games. But behind that lies some highly cultured narrative design that weaves the disparate elements together into an impressive whole."
1878,102,Road 96,90,Gamepressure,"Sep 11, 2021","Road 96’s procedurally generated scenarios make each playthrough unique and yet manage to string together and become a rich, interwoven story that has heart. Because no two trips are the same, your experience will be uniquely yours and dependent on the choices you make. Regardless of what happens, each journey down its winding roads is an enjoyable ride of emotions, laughs, and surprises that is sure to please."

Everyone will walk out of Petria (if lucky) with their own unique stories to tell, and they’re certain to be entertaining ones."
1881,102,Road 96,90,God is a Geek,"Aug 16, 2021",Road 96 tells a poignant story of those trying to escape a corrupt and dangerous country through great gameplay and multiple playthroughs.
1882,102,Road 96,90,Worth Playing,"Aug 16, 2021","Road 96 shows that it is possible to do a ""roguelike,"" narrative-focused story and do it well. It's a shockingly engaging and well-written game with likeable characters. It's sometimes funny, sometimes terrifying, and sometimes thought-provoking, but no matter what, it never gets boring. Each setback or revelation made me eager to see the next, and my ending felt like a satisfying resolution to the plot that I'd been building. If there were ever a game that defined, ""It's the journey, not the destination,"" it's Road 96, and if you're a fan of quirky, narrative-driven games, then this is well worth a shot."
1883,102,Road 96,90,IGN Spain,"Aug 16, 2021","Road 96 becomes, thanks to its fine writing and its ability to make you think and reflect, into one of the best independent video games of 2021. An excellent journey of encounters with your ideals and, above all, with those of others."
1884,102,Road 96,86,MGG Spain,"Aug 16, 2021","Road 96 is an experience that you will remember in a few years if you let yourself be absorbed by its world. His first few bars may be confusing, but as the minutes go by and the puzzles begin to fit together, you determine what he wants to tell and how straightforward his message is. All this outlined with a cast of charismatic characters written in a fantastic way."
1885,102,Road 96,83,The Games Machine,"Aug 16, 2021","Road 96 is a nice revelation. The slow start gives the wrong impression of a game similar to many recent narrative adventures: well written, but without that peculiar something that can make it shine. Instead, its formula based on the repetition of the paths and on the procedurality of the encounters proved to be a great strength in the long run, capable of adding depth to the game and distinguishing it from its (valid) predecessors. More than this, it's the perfect game for summertime: a good song on the radio, the long road ahead of us, sunglasses on and a future where plenty of choices await."
1886,102,Road 96,83,KeenGamer,"Aug 16, 2021","Just like a solid road trip, Road 96 is filled with ups and downs. As you strive to survive Petria’s worst roadblocks, you’ll find yourself making defining decisions. Even if the world of Petria isn’t as defined, the characters more than make up for the long, empty stretches of road. Road 96 is game that makes you think long and hard about both the journey and the destination."
1887,102,Road 96,82,Impulsegamer,"Sep 27, 2021","It could be argued it’s a little pricey for a game that can be quite short… so maybe wait for a sale, but if you like storytelling then you will likely enjoy this title."
1888,102,Road 96,82,RPG Fan,"Aug 16, 2021","Road 96 offers a unique style and storytelling that the gaming industry desperately needs right now. I worry that this one will float under many people’s radar as it’s by no means an edge-of-your-seat story with larger-than-life actors. This is a chill game with cozy vibes mixed with a little bit of social unrest to shake things up a bit. Conflict! At any rate, if you have the need for this sort of title in your life, Road 96 scratches the itch well."
1889,102,Road 96,80,Adventure Gamers,"Dec 17, 2021","Though not entirely successful as a broad narrative experience, Road 96 presents a series of compelling individual character studies whose offbeat sense of humor and heart make for a rewarding road trip."
1890,102,Road 96,80,GamesHub,"Dec 13, 2021","Developer Digixart has crafted a thoughtful look at what it’s like to live in tumultuous circumstances, and how it can affect people emotionally. It’s sadly prescient of the world we actually live in, and maybe that’s why Road 96’s message of survival and perseverance make the impact it does, at least the first time around."
1891,102,Road 96,80,IGN France,"Aug 29, 2021","More than ever the trip is more important than the destination in Road 96, a game that works thanks to its stylish artistic direction, good writing, and some gameplay that stirs and spice up the narration."
1892,102,Road 96,80,DarkZero,"Aug 23, 2021","Overall Road 96 really surprised me, as I’m getting older, purely story driven games don’t grab my interest as easily. However, putting my headphones on and getting taken on this wonderful journey, that is made all the more better by the heart-warming soundtrack that coincides perfectly with Road 96, took my breath away. The only gripe I have is that later on the game can get too easy, however, I learned to just sit back and enjoy my time with these wonderful characters. I was laughing, upset, and sometimes even scared while I was playing. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Road 96."
1893,102,Road 96,80,GamesBeat,"Aug 17, 2021","One of the great things about the game is that you can keep on playing it until you get through the storylines of all of the main characters. The game is replayable to the point where you can experiment with different kinds of pro-revolutionary or pro-moderate behaviors. But it doesn’t judge you on the choices you make. It only makes clear that your choices matter, and your road to hell can be paved with good intentions."
1894,102,Road 96,80,TheGamer,"Aug 16, 2021","Much like the real world, everyone’s hopes and dreams are different, and it’s this uniqueness that makes them so undeniably beautiful. It’s a poetic struggle, and stopping to appreciate the instances of silence on a road filled with tragedy and heartbreak helps Road 96 feel like something I’ve never played before. Road 96 feels like an experience created by a studio that understands the fragility of the world we exist in, seeking to project these issues onto a fictional world where comparing them with our own is all too easy. Subtlety isn’t the objective here, and by pulling no punches, this game manages to say something well worth listening to."
1895,102,Road 96,80,Vandal,"Aug 16, 2021","Perhaps it is difficult to explain and understand where the strengths of the Road 96 concept lie, but we can assure you that we are facing a very good game that makes the most of its curious narrative exercise, one in which the linearity of a cinematic story is combined with the procedural nature of a 'choose your own adventure', all this while it is played with making decisions that help to build a plot that we feel as our own, although perhaps not so much. At times the game's history seems too on track for that player's agency to matter, at least that's the feeling it gets, and between that and the fictional disambiguation, which makes it fall into multiple genre clichés that prevent it getting wet in the topics it deals with, subtracts points from a work that is otherwise the most interesting that has been published this year."
1896,102,Road 96,80,IGN Italia,"Aug 16, 2021","Road 96 is a brilliant and clever take on choose-your-own-adventure game. Thanks to its complex, but coherent narrative which works on multiple runs, Digixart succeeds in telling the story of pride, revolution and hope through intimate moments and an interesting cast of characters."
1897,102,Road 96,80,Eurogamer Italy,"Aug 16, 2021","Certainly Road 96 isn't a game for the masses, it's a bit of a niche. But this does not mean that it cannot please those who want to try something new and special. If you like compelling and captivating stories, backstories and slightly daring adventures, if you love the fact that every choice made has a weight on the unfolding of events, then it is a title that you could and should try. It is certainly an experience different from many others that in the end they all look a bit alike."
1898,102,Road 96,80,Twinfinite,"Aug 16, 2021","Road 96 is a special title well worth checking out for anyone with an itch for adventure. Its replayability may be limited, but for its budget price tag, this is one narrative-driven, decision-based adventure that almost completely delivers on its ambitious vision for the genre."
1899,102,Road 96,80,IGN,"Aug 16, 2021",Road 96 is a fascinating and frequently tense adventure that manages to keep its story on track despite the odd bump in the road.
1900,102,Road 96,80,Noisy Pixel,"Aug 16, 2021","The randomizing order of narrative sections mixed with the more traditional choice-based elements of Road 96 made for a compelling experience. Adding in wacky but ultimately human characters really fleshed out the world of Petria and gave some moral dilemmas weight. The occasional mini-games were also enjoyable to break up the dialogue. If you are looking for a narrative adventure that deviates a bit off the normal path, Road 96 is definitely a trip you should consider embarking on."

Still, this playthrough, despite some flaws in logic and overall simplicity of the game, will bring you joy and a dozen awesome songs for your playlist."

1906,102,Road 96,75,Destructoid,"Aug 16, 2021","The beauty of Road 96 isn’t that it’s thematically or mechanically well-executed, because it’s sometimes not. Every so often, you’ll hit a rough patch that just doesn’t jive and jars you out of your immersion. Sometimes that’s mechanical, other times a character will act against their established motivations. I think that can be forgiven, but there will be some who can’t move past the awkward moments. Yet, I can’t help but feel entranced by Road 96’s framework; the depiction of a journey as being a bunch of moments. Moments where you dig into a character’s psyche or just have fun playing air hockey. It’s lightweight, effective, and I can’t think of another place where it’s this well-executed. If you’re willing to stomach the rough patches and politics, there’s a rich game within. One that explores how people affect and are affected by the world. Personally, I think it’s worth the trip."
1907,102,Road 96,70,Cubed3,"Oct 22, 2021","Toothless as political commentary, and with its, supposedly, big focus on choice being almost non-existent, it would be alright to assume that this isn't a big recommendation - and yet it is. Digixart's anti-fascist indie might not be as good it thinks when it comes to politics, and the choose-your-own-adventure layer under it all is paper-thin at best, but simply as an experience, as a road trip across a beautiful land, filled with interesting (to say the least) characters, yes, this is one of the best indies that have been released this past month, warts and all. Its replay value is, unfortunately, very low, but do yourself a favour, and try it out when you get the chance. Road 96 is a flawed but undoubtedly memorable journey."
1908,102,Road 96,70,PC Games,"Sep  6, 2021","Road 96’s story is very interactive and all of our choices have consequences that can be very small or completely change what’s going to happen. Because of that, the replayability is immense. However, the texture quality is bad and gameplay-wise, Road 96 is nothing more than a walking simulator. So you better be in for the story!"
1909,102,Road 96,70,Gamer.nl,"Aug 24, 2021",Road 96 tells a political story through short but intense adventures with fascinating characters. Your choices shape the story and that ambitious set-up works surprisingly well.
1910,102,Road 96,70,The Indie Game Website,"Aug 19, 2021","Even with some messy execution on its political themes, Road 96 succeeds at capturing a fractious journey on the road and the turmoil of modern American politics. A deeper exploration of Petria’s history may give more context to the game’s narrative of taking change of your own destiny. But without this background, it ends up oversimplifying its premise by positing that the only barrier to equity and justice is a strongman in a suit. In reality, injustice runs far deeper."
1911,102,Road 96,70,Multiplayer.it,"Aug 16, 2021","Road 96 is, ultimately, a successful adventure, which, however, never manages to get to the bottom, limiting itself to exposing its vision in the most didactic way possible."

It is still very much an enjoyable experience with fun mini-games, a beautiful visual style and soundtrack, along with the interesting mechanic of having to make the trip to the border multiple times. It’s upsetting that the game loses itself when it tries to tackle politics when it really should have focused more on the relationships between the characters and their journeys on the road. Despite this, it was still great fun to play the whole way through."
1914,102,Road 96,70,GameSkinny,"Aug 16, 2021","Road 96 sets out to ask hard questions such as ""when is violence the right response to a despotic regime?"" and ""is voting alone enough to fix a broken system?"".

1917,102,Road 96,60,GameMAG,"Aug 16, 2021","Road 96 is a game that fall short of its promises. Branching storylines all have the same outcomes, and subplots of many characters are to predictable, even if a little funny."
1918,103,Super Robot Wars 30,90,Forbes,"Jan 19, 2022","Overall, Super Robot Wars 30 is an excellent tribute to the 30th anniversary of the series. The new mission setup is a bit daunting at first but works well on multiple playthroughs and with the new DLC. Considering the challenges the development team must have faced during the pandemic to get this game done, it’s remarkable how well it all turned out."

1920,103,Super Robot Wars 30,87,RPG Fan,"Dec 21, 2021","I loved every second I spent with this game and am grateful that the opportunity to play it presented itself. Whenever I was at work, all I could think about was coming home to play it. I even contemplated burning a sick day or two so I could stay home and play it all day. Despite its flaws, Super Robot Wars 30 most certainly cast the spell on me that it’s been casting on fans for the past 30 years, and I look forward to 30 more."

1922,103,Super Robot Wars 30,80,GameSpace,"Feb  1, 2022","Overall, Super Robot Wars 30 is a good addition to the series for fans of the previous titles. While it may not be the type of game I would play that doesn’t stop me from appreciating the hard work that has been put into it. From the graphics to the audio and the story, it plays like an anime story that you play through."

Its revamped narrative logic complements the characteristics of Super Robot Wars. However, I was slightly disappointed by the conservative battle. For most fans, this should be a satisfactory answer, but for the future of Super Robot Wars series, it failed in its performance."

It's a great encapsulation of what makes the franchise shine, and it's filled to the brim with fanservice in a way that will warm even the coldest mecha fan's heart. On its own merits, it is a lengthy and enjoyable (if easy) SRPG, but it really shines if you know the source material. It's not for everyone, but if SRW30 is for you, it'll give you everything you could possibly want."

No expense was spared bringing crunchy strategy rules and every mecha IP under the sun into one full throttle extravaganza. And even if you are a complete noob like me, this feels like a great entry to the wider world of giant robot anime. I suppose if you are only looking for the most finely honed strategy game and style is meaningless to you, you’re not going to find what you are looking for in Super Robot Wars 30. But give it a chance, it might grab you with a 10 foot long mechanized fist and not let go."

Certainly not for those expecting a deep and challenging strategy game, as almost the entire experience plays on fanservice. Not to mention a roster incapable of giving back the encyclopaedic feeling that an event like the 30th anniversary would require."

It’s an approachable SRPG no matter your skill level but shows age in its menu design and limited tutorials. Still, it managed to rope me in for hours of enjoyment as I survived off this mecha feast for days. So, here’s to another 30 years of Super Robot Wars."

If there is one common thread throughout every single SRW game, it has always been to form your giant robot dream team and have fun breaking the game in half with them. SRW 30 is no different."

1932,104,Blizzard Arcade Collection,90,Worth Playing,"Mar 11, 2021","Although it's light on actual games for the price, the Blizzard Arcade Collection shows off an intense amount of love for the included games. While the creation of the definitive editions of these games is welcome and the result does a great job of matching it up with modern standards, the inclusion of the different console editions is a great forward-thinking move for game preservation. The inclusion of lots of supplementary material is excellent for those who are interested in the history of these titles, and the games stand the test of time rather well. It also helps that the titles remain fun even today. Whether you're discovering these games for the first time or want to play them again, this is a compilation that's worth checking out."

1934,104,Blizzard Arcade Collection,80,Shacknews,"Feb 26, 2021","The Blizzard Arcade Collection isn't a perfect compilation by any means, but for the advancements that Blizzard made on some of these games without compromising the old-school visuals make it a must-own. The Museum is also a fun look back at the making of some of these old gems. Rock N Roll Racing by itself is more than worth the price of admission, but The Lost Vikings and Blackthorne are such unique time capsules of old-school Blizzard design that they're worth experiencing."
1935,104,Blizzard Arcade Collection,75,Vandal,"Feb 25, 2021","This is a decent collection to discover some of the Blizzard classics. It’s missing many features found in similar compilations, but at least these games are now available on modern platforms."

The additional features such as rewind and save states, when available at least, are delightful improvements, and the definitive editions work amazingly well. I’m also impressed with such a great behind the scenes section with a lot of interesting content. But most of this smorgasbord is par for the course, and I expect a little more out of Blizzard. It falls under the competent category, rather than revolutionary."
1937,104,Blizzard Arcade Collection,70,Eurogamer Italy,"Mar  8, 2021","Blizzard delivers us the perfect “Operation Nostalgia” with three titles that made history. Rock N Roll Racing is the real value of the compilation, followed by Lost Vikings, which aged graciously. We sadly cannot say the same for Blackthorne, klunky in gameplay and controls."
1938,104,Blizzard Arcade Collection,70,Jeuxvideo.com,"Mar  5, 2021","Some people will find the price a bit steep, and they probably won't be wrong. Yet, apart from the drastic selection of this compilation, Blizzard Arcade Collection has been the subject of real care."
1939,105,Curse of the Dead Gods,90,GameSkinny,"Mar  2, 2021","If you just want an old-school roguelike to test your mettle, you can't go wrong with Curse of the Dead Gods. It's the right mix of challenge and experimentation, providing dozens of hours of playtime before it starts to wear. After that, you may even find self-imposed challenges and the chase of perfection enough to keep you delving back in for another run."
1940,105,Curse of the Dead Gods,90,IGN,"Feb 23, 2021","Even without the curses themselves, Curse of the Dead Gods would be a standout roguelite with excellent combat, a smart structure that eases you into its difficulty, and a great variety of enemies, traps, and bosses across its three distinct temples. That strong foundation is only made better by the fun randomization curses bring to each run, on top of the added strategic element that comes with having to balance the need to gear up quickly with the fear of taking on more corruption than you can handle. Its between-run progression systems didn’t do much to hook me compared to the simple drive to best its hardest challenges, but even without that carrot on a stick, Curse of the Dead Gods is a blessing in disguise."
1941,105,Curse of the Dead Gods,85,CD-Action,"Nov 15, 2021","My first impression of Curse of the Dead Gods was that someone mixed Hades with Darkest Dungeon. However, such a simplification would be unfair, because the game does more than just borrow successful mechanics. It adds its own interesting ideas to the mix and the result is a pretty dungeon crawler with an intuitive and satisfying combat system. The environments could use more variety and I would welcome a story to follow while hacking and slashing, but overall Curse of the Dead Gods is a great, highly addictive game. [05/2021, p.46]"
1942,105,Curse of the Dead Gods,85,GamingTrend,"Feb 23, 2021","Curse of the Dead Gods is fantastic. The gameplay, while incredibly challenging, is still fun and immensely rewarding. It's so satisfying to finally complete a dungeon after spending hours grinding there. It's a roguelite in nearly the best sense of the word, with the only downside being that there's no established story; no tangible endgame."

1946,105,Curse of the Dead Gods,80,RPG Fan,"Apr 12, 2021","Part of the appeal of roguelikes is the depth. Since static maps aren’t developed and a linear (or non-linear) story doesn’t unfold in typical RPG fashion, a generous serving of content is almost required. Curse of the Dead Gods feels like a proof of concept in this way, because what’s here is tight, enticing, and consistent, but it needs more. Without meaningful changes across runs, everything just kinda bleeds together. Maybe that’s okay. Maybe Curse of the Dead Gods was always intended to be a 15-hour game. If that’s what you’re after, then by all means, but a game like this needs teeth and a degree of chaos oftentimes found in other roguelikes. With this hybrid genre hotter than ever, maybe it came out of development just a little too late."
1947,105,Curse of the Dead Gods,80,IGN Portugal,"Mar 18, 2021","Curse of The Dead Gods stands out for its combat system, phenomenally supported by a set of mechanisms that will have you constantly second-guessing your decisions. The curses' randomness gives it a lot of flexibility and transforms every attempt into a frenetic head-scratcher. The sum of all parts of the game results in an experience that will keep you playing just because you want to beat it again and again."
1948,105,Curse of the Dead Gods,80,DarkZero,"Mar 11, 2021","It may end up being a little too simple and repetitive once you figure out the secret sauce but by that point I think the combat, exploration, and initial challenge should have already satiated any interested party’s appetite. The end game is for sure disappointing, basically just increasing enemy and trap damage, and the daily single-play events only really permanently cursing the player with whatever old status effect means there isn’t much replayability once you reach the end, but it is still there if you want it. For everybody else I’d say check it out, get your 25-hours of exciting action, and get out. Oh! – and nerf the bow!"
1949,105,Curse of the Dead Gods,80,GameOver.gr,"Mar  5, 2021","Curse of the Dead Gods shines on top of the myriads of roguelikes (the recent indie fad) thanks to its focus on its combat system and the vast number of weapons and synergies between them. It may not bring an evolution to the genre as Hades did, but nevertheless its developer has a great understanding of the intricacies of roguelikes."
1950,105,Curse of the Dead Gods,80,IGN France,"Feb 24, 2021",Curse of the Dead Gods is a great action roguelite title that let you balance risk with precise control and complex gameplay mechanisms. PassTech Games will need to flesh it out a bit in the coming months though.

1953,105,Curse of the Dead Gods,73,Game Informer,"Mar 19, 2021","Overall, Curse of the Dead Gods is a solid roguelite, though it doesn’t attempt anything revolutionary or ambitious. Its familiar approach to genre-specific structure makes it easy to dive right into without fearing a loss of the challenge. The different strategic approaches available with the upgrades system also makes progression feel rewarding. The art, the variety of curses, and the overall formula that Curse of the Dead Gods follows make it a tale worth exploring, even if the moral of the story is that greed equals painful and agonizing death."
1954,105,Curse of the Dead Gods,73,4Players.de,"Mar 12, 2021","Great battles, but not much to back it up. Curse of the Dead Gods puts its focus on the brutal and challenging skirmishes and offers too little on the side."
1955,105,Curse of the Dead Gods,70,Game Rant,"Mar 10, 2021","There is a lot about Curse of the Dead Gods that ticks the familiar boxes of a solid roguelike. A cool art style, engaging combat, some fun twists on the genre, and a sense of progression are key to making it engaging and addictive. Without a meaty story driving the experience, though, Curse of the Dead Gods relies heavily on its gameplay to keep players coming back for more. Motivation is ultimately going to be the driving factor for players. If they believe they can overcome seemingly insurmountable odds, Curse of the Dead Gods will feel like a rewarding experience once they complete a full run."
1956,105,Curse of the Dead Gods,70,KeenGamer,"Mar  3, 2021","This is absolutely a quality game, you won't miss your $20, but is it high art to be revered among the greats? Probably not. It's a fun, stylized roguelike with just enough variety to get by, but lacks the substance it needs to make a lasting impression. Most will probably get about 25 hours out of it and move on to something else. Great value for the price, but likely not something you'll come back to time and again."
1957,105,Curse of the Dead Gods,70,PC Invasion,"Feb 23, 2021","Curse of the Dead Gods' combat system is extremely rewarding, and the challenge will keep you on your toes.

1958,105,Curse of the Dead Gods,69,Riot Pixels,"May  7, 2021","At a first glance, Curse of the Dead Gods offers enough variety and exciting nuance to take a deep dive, but quickly loses steam and devolves into tedious chaos."
1959,106,Axiom Verge 2,100,But Why Tho?,"Aug 11, 2021","Axiom Verge 2 is an outstanding game that really sets the bar for future indie Metroidvania games. It builds on the original’s success by introducing new mechanics and ideas that help freshen up a classic and sometimes stale genre. I loved every second of my journey as Indra, and I know you will too."
1960,106,Axiom Verge 2,90,Siliconera,"Aug 19, 2021","All in all, though, these are relatively minor blemishes on an impressive, bold follow-up to an acclaimed modern classic. Whether you’ve been champing at the bit for a new take on Axiom Verge or if this is your first experience with a Metroidvania, Axiom Verge 2 is a dense, beautiful game that’s easier than ever to get into and shouldn’t be missed."

1963,106,Axiom Verge 2,80,Multiplayer.it,"Aug 24, 2021","Maybe Axiom Verge 2 is not the sequel that fans of the first game expected. The metroidvania structure appears to be way more focused on exploration and puzzle solving: a different path for the series, but equally enjoyable once you get to understand it."
1964,106,Axiom Verge 2,80,Shacknews,"Aug 18, 2021","Axiom Verge 2 was more of what I wanted for the most part. Thomas Happ’s understanding of the metroidvania formula works very well throughout the game and it even changes up quite nicely from what the first game had for us. I enjoyed exploring and discovering new abilities, taking in the atmosphere of music and pixels, and platforming through varied pitfalls and foes. Combat feels half-baked and sometimes I really wish the game would have just told me what it wanted me to do next to move the story forward. The narrative going on is intriguing, but also a bit too technobabble at times. Even so, it’s a journey that pushes you into the unknown to overcome a vast tapestry of obstacles and enemies in stark isolation. For that, Axiom Verge 2 continues to nail down the Metroidvania-style in a solid and challenging way."
1965,106,Axiom Verge 2,80,Hardcore Gamer,"Aug 11, 2021","Axiom Verge 2 is exactly what a sequel should be in that it’s more of the same but different.  Indra isn’t Trace so her skills and abilities don’t try to mirror his too closely, and the world she’s been dropped into frequently has wide open vistas in its background instead of more types of caverns.  The level design is every bit as good if not better, featuring varied biomes that stand on their own but eventually all interconnect as new skills open up more passages.  The switch back and forth between Indra and the drone provides a nice change of pace, with each earning different abilities that complement the other.  And of course the soundtrack is fantastic, with its non-US-traditional instruments and vocalizing.  If you loved the first Axiom Verge then odds are good the second one is everything you hoped for, and if you’ve never played the original then the standalone nature of the sequel means you don’t have to worry about having missed out.  Either way, Axiom Verge 2 is an excellent Metroidvania, and a rare perfect example of a series that can balance quality and change to deliver something new."
1966,106,Axiom Verge 2,80,Destructoid,"Aug 11, 2021","Even when Axiom Verge 2 wasn’t hitting perfectly for me, it feels different and very much its own. Things start out slow, but give it a little time and Axiom Verge 2 really gets going, playing off expectations with clever alterations of the original game’s conventions. It’s dense as ever lore-wise, and it’s got some good music and worlds to move through. It’s a follow-up to Axiom Verge that doesn’t content itself with a simple recitation of the first game’s high points, and if what’s detailed above sounds like your jam, you’ll probably have a good time with it."
1967,106,Axiom Verge 2,78,Game Informer,"Aug 11, 2021","Even when Axiom Verge 2 left me frustrated, I never lost the sense of its intelligent design and mind-bending premise. With these first two games, Happ has laid the groundwork for a particularly weird and captivating fiction, and we’ve only just scratched the surface of its secrets. While I hope I don’t have to wait another six years to play Axiom Verge 3, I’m fascinated enough to have a controller at the ready for its inevitable return."
1968,106,Axiom Verge 2,70,PC Games,"Sep 25, 2021","Cards on the table: Metroid is a series that I haven't had too close ties to for a long time. I am rather indifferent. That's why I didn't care about the open surroundings and the focus on hand-to-hand combat instead of firearms - but I understand if some fans of the predecessor would have wished for something else. On the other hand, I find it unhappy how lax and low-tension the fights are. For example, I raked the flying ox on the opposite side with an ice ax until it was dead. In such banal arguments, the joy of victory is limited. There are certainly people who have a better sense of direction than I do, because in some places I was quite at a loss as to where to go next. Here is my tip: If in doubt, go to the breach area. By the way, an all-round good innovation is the teleporting of memory points. That saves Indra a long walk or two."
1969,106,Axiom Verge 2,70,GameSpot,"Aug 16, 2021","Simple combat, forgettable boss fights, and a reticent narrative--not to mention an overly vague map--are the only dampeners on what is an impressive sequel, despite never quite feeling like one. The unsuspected changes and additions are bold and mostly pay off, with consistently engaging and rewarding exploration that's propelled forward by an ambitious central mechanic. Axiom Verge 2 is a game that constantly evolves and delights, but just lacks the same bite as some of its contemporaries."
1970,106,Axiom Verge 2,70,IGN,"Aug 11, 2021",Axiom Verge 2 is a dual-dimensional Metroidvania that’s engaging to explore despite its one-dimensional combat and underwhelming boss fights.
1971,106,Axiom Verge 2,70,Jeuxvideo.com,"Aug 11, 2021","Axiom Verge 2 impresses with its level design. Its complex structure supported by two parallel worlds accessible at all times will offer a major challenge to aficionados of metroidvania.

1972,106,Axiom Verge 2,68,Vandal,"Sep  8, 2021","Axiom Verge 2 is a very different sequel that can’t really match the greatness of the original, but that we would recommend to those who enjoy non-linear platformers."

1975,107,Grow: Song of the Evertree,80,Destructoid,"Dec  2, 2021","There are some rough edges to be found, and one person’s relaxation will be another’s repetition. However, Grow: Song of the Evertree succeeds in its attempts at presenting a wholesome, laid-back experience. Its successes are admirable, and its missteps are negligible. It lives up to its philosophy and presents something that has all the satisfying progression of a typical game experience, but without all the violence. There’s still room to grow, but the roots are firmly planted."
1976,107,Grow: Song of the Evertree,80,TheGamer,"Nov 16, 2021","Once you get going, it’s hard to put Grow down. Animal Crossing tends to have a firm cut off point each day where you know you’re best leaving it until the island replenishes, but in Grow, you can sleep and keep going. It’s therapeutic in a way that even its inspirations aren’t. Often games like this can get overwhelming fast as new features pile on. Grow doesn’t - it’s simple and to the point, so that relaxing sensation never wanes."

1979,107,Grow: Song of the Evertree,74,IGN Italia,"Nov 29, 2021","The new Prideful Sloth's game has the same philosophy as its predecessor: peace, relax and nature and wildlife-related activities accompany us for hours in a sandbox that makes micro-management its own core. In the shoes of the last alchemist who can save Alaria we will have to strengthen ourselves by casting out the Withering, cultivating new worlds and building districts, houses and squares to make the city become a place to live again. Despite the presence of interesting mechanics, such as the creation of new worlds and an exploratory component that tries to tie the activities of the game, so much repetition and too many simplifications make it lose some magic after the first dozen hours of gameplay, especially after finding out the multiples technical uncertainties. However, it will surely get sandbox lovers to spend many hours experiencing it."

1992,108,Happy Game,70,Shacknews,"Oct 27, 2021","Those looking for a short, unsettling stroll can find one with Happy Game. One thing to note about it is that it's a short romp, able to be completed in just a few hours.

Adios could have been a one-dimensional story about a man who has nothing left to live for, but through a series of short, concise conversations, the game does an exceptional job of fleshing out this character, humanizing him, and giving meaning to his death. That’s a lot to do in just an hour, but Adios handles it beautifully."
1999,109,Adios,80,Screen Rant,"Mar 17, 2021","Adios feels personal and honest. It's a story that has seeds of remorse and capitalizes on a lot of the worst fears that some have for when they get older. The way those fears emerge bubbling on the surface of Adios's admittedly thin gameplay mechanics makes for compelling story-telling. Even in a short title bereft of many of the bells and whistles that characterize some of the best visual novel or VN-adjacent experiences, that masterful balance makes for something well worth a look for those who can look past its obvious flaws."
2000,109,Adios,75,PC Invasion,"Mar 17, 2021","Adios is brief and mostly concerned with dialogue, but it's a thought-provoking piece of interactive fiction, even if the visual style clashes with the narrative."
2001,109,Adios,70,GameCritics,"Apr  6, 2021","In an industry full of people who fancy themselves master storytellers but can rarely back it up, it’s refreshing to play a title that feels well-studied in more traditional narrative forms. I hope Adios is successful, and that we’ll see more like it."
2002,109,Adios,70,GameSpew,"Mar 17, 2021","Ultimately, while Adios might not match your initial expectations, particularly if you’ve read the slightly sneaky Steam store deception, it’s still a captivating ride. Adios may be a brief goodbye but the echoes of this farewell will stick with you for days."
2003,109,Adios,65,Noisy Pixel,"Mar 30, 2021","Adios excels in its creative writing through its complicated moral narrative. The characters are shown as complex even with a short runtime, and it’s easy to get emotionally invested in this farmer’s life. However, the limited interactivity really weighs on the experience as it drags in places that make it feel longer than it is. I wasn’t sold on the direction and really felt like there could have been a lot more here."

Maybe the effort spent on combining dice and cards has caused other features to be overlooked, and the game is sometimes a bit slow and with little interaction, but this does not impair the experience of playing an artistically very well done game, with a great story and the right amount of humor like I haven't seen in a long time."

The wondrous deck building mechanics that gave rise to explosive effects, the visually impressive world, the whimsical soundtrack and the story of a young heroine rescuing her sister from an evil queen. There were a few frame rate drops and glitches, mind, but nothing that a day one patch won't smooth over. If you're after a game that is challenging yet thought-provoking, introducing you to sumptuous storybook realms that you won't want to leave, then this is one I wholeheartedly recommend."

The Tim-Burton visuals and the kooky cast of characters you’ll meet in each distinctively different region means there’s never a dull moment to this journey. Clever strategy card elements help to mask the game’s rather unremarkable real-time combat, with some control issues that hurt the overall experience. Yet despite its flaws, Lost in Random still brings the goods and had me engaged from unlucky start to triumphantly random end."
2021,111,Lost in Random,80,AusGamers,"Sep 10, 2021","Interesting combat aside, what resonates and exhilarates about Lost in Random is its story first and foremost. The adventure that Even embarks on is one to savour and one that lives up to the wonderful art direction and visual design. The characters, the dialogue, the discoveries, the animation, the voice acting, the music, the presentation -- it all comes together wonderfully. A game well worth taking a chance and rolling the dice on."
2022,111,Lost in Random,80,Screen Rant,"Sep 10, 2021","Lost in Random is certainly a unique and interesting game, in spite of its flaws and aside from its inspirations. The art style may give the impression of journeying through a Tim Burton-inspired, imaginative landscape, but Lost in Random has its own identity that makes it worth exploring. Despite its faults, the combat's close similarities to 3D version of the Megaman Battle Network and Starforce series in all of the best ways makes it highly entertaining. Lost in Random is an innovative and enjoyable take on its genre, and a game that’s very easy to get lost in."

It’s worth playing even if you don’t make it to the end, simply because there’s never been another game like it. Disney goths will delight in its charming blend of cute and macabre, and there are some legitimate thrills to be had with the combat system for strategy-brained players like myself. If it had continued to innovate with new battle mechanics and more cards to collect throughout the entire game, it would be an easy contender for game of the year for me. Unfortunately, it rests on its laurels too early, and the game as a whole suffers for it. I would be eager to return to Random were there ever a sequel, but I don’t think I’ll be revisiting Lost in Random again anytime soon."

2034,111,Lost in Random,60,NME,"Sep 13, 2021","Lost in Random is a dark fantasy tale full of amusing characters and macabre manifestations of a world built on chance. It falls short, however, in trying to turn its dice rolling random element into a compelling action experience, and outside of combat struggles to come up with interesting things for players to do. An enjoyable story married to a game that’s far from offensive, but certainly a little bland."

However, he can be criticized for relying a little too much on the qualities of the initial game as well as a jagged pace, in particular because of a somewhat sluggish start to the adventure.

While it's nice to be introduced to some new and important characters, they don't see much development, which contributes to a plot that doesn't feel very impactful. The game doesn't do much to challenge the player in combat or puzzles, but it excels in immersion. Between its intuitive zero-G locomotion and (at times) open map design, it's just a bit magical to feel like you're really outside of a derelict space station orbiting Saturn. The game could have benefited from better pacing and a bit more threat and tension, but if you liked doing space chores the first time around, you'll enjoy it here too."

Despite arriving four years after the groundbreaking original, there’s very little that will surprise you here and, although well written, the drawn-out character dialogue quickly wears thin. It’s still held up by a fantastic locomotion system with first-rate immersion alongside a solid story with believable performances, but the startling spark of blockbuster innovation that fuelled the first game has long-since died out. Jack and Liv’s mission to get back to the past makes for a fun ride, but parts of Lone Echo 2 were stuck there to begin with."

GTFO stands out as a unique cooperative horror experience due to its gameplay design, one that I am fully relishing, even after countless deaths and failed runs."

The gunplay leaves a lot to be desired as the catalog of assault rifles, SMGs, pistols, and shotguns feel the same, but stealth runs are satisfying to plan out with others. Guttural screeches of enemies are bloodcurdling during engagements, while dark and complicated backdrops limit sightlines and keep me on my toes. GTFO isn’t for the faint of heart. Nevertheless, the fear of death means that re-strategizing and improvising are commonplace, which is a metagame that feels disappointingly absent in most cooperative shooters as of late.

There's just enough horror and action to satisfy a wide variety of players, but finding those players and gathering them on a regular basis can be a hassle.

Riders Republic is a playground complete with excitement."
2075,114,Riders Republic,77,Merlin'in Kazanı (Turkey),"Nov  3, 2021",Riders Republic misses its chance to be a great game due to some of its lacks in customization and gameplay. An extremely fun game that anyone who loves extreme sports should try.
2076,114,Riders Republic,75,TrueGaming,"Nov 29, 2021","Riders Republic is a very good extreme sports game, its ambitious and there are loads of contents and things to do with grand challenges online, but they are offered to the player with the Ubisoft style that became a bit too familiar over the years."
2077,114,Riders Republic,75,Jeuxvideo.com,"Nov  3, 2021","If Riders Republic may disappoint Steep fans (the title goes against the spirit of the game of 2016), this new production remains a must for all thrill seekers. With its many playable sports disciplines, starting with the bike which offers exhilarating sensations, its exotic world and its many modes available both solo and online, the latest production from Ubisoft Annecy will undoubtedly keep you busy for the long haul."
2078,114,Riders Republic,72,Game World Navigator Magazine,"Dec 15, 2021","Kudos to Ubisoft for being brave enough to release a full-scale game focused on extreme sports – we definitely need more of these. Now for the bad news: like most Ubisoft games, at least half of the content is either superfluous, or underdeveloped. Only skiing and snowboarding are actually good, bikes are tolerable at best, and skydiving is just meh. [Issue#257, p.68]"
2079,114,Riders Republic,72,MMORPG.com,"Nov 24, 2021","There is more than enough variety to keep players coming back and having fun for months, just with the solo and collectible game alone. If you’re an extreme sports fan, Riders Republic is a no-brainer. For MMO fans looking for more than a madcap mass race challenge, I would let the game mature for a few months longer before picking this one up."
2080,114,Riders Republic,71,PC Gamer,"Nov  2, 2021",Extreme sports made accessible to the point of basic. It's got a tin ear but a big heart.
2081,114,Riders Republic,70,PC Games,"Nov  9, 2021","If you're into open worlds and extreme sports, Riders Republic is great. At least for about twenty hours. The world is gigantic and because of the intuitive controls the different sports are all fun to play. But Riders Republic falls into the same trap as its predecessor Steep, when it promises endless fun, but after a while there is no content anymore, if you are not willing to grind and play the same events over and over again. Besides there are technical issues with the Mass Races. It is always a gamble, if the race works or you get kicked out of the session."
2082,114,Riders Republic,60,Gameblog.fr,"Nov  2, 2021","Riders Republic tries to improve the Steep formula on many levels, but sometimes fails to really find its own way: by constantly soliciting the players with its trials, rewards, gears, modes and extras, Ubisoft Annecy's new formula sometimes forgets to let us enjoy the ride and its vast landscape."
2083,115,Unbound: Worlds Apart,90,Adventure Gamers,"Dec 10, 2021","While its story never really soars, Unbound: Worlds Apart presents a brilliant and elegant Metroidvania type of gameplay that challenges both the mind and the reflexes. It’s perhaps a bit too twitchy for your diehard adventure gamer, but anyone who can handle a little action with their puzzles will fall in love with the beautiful art style and fun, finely tuned gameplay here."
2084,115,Unbound: Worlds Apart,90,CD-Action,"Oct 12, 2021","Clichéd and predictable story might not be Unbound’s strong point, but the level design and mechanics definitely are. Behind the game’s fairy-tale charm, fantastic visuals and great music you’ll find masterfully crafted and challenging gameplay. This Romanian indie gem is not only highly polished, but also wonderfully varied and exciting from start to finish. [10/2021, p.76]"
2085,115,Unbound: Worlds Apart,90,Screen Rant,"Jul 28, 2021","From Ori and the Blind Forest’s difficulty to Limbo’s puzzles and aesthetic, Unbound displays its inspirations with aplomb. On top of the innovative gameplay mechanics, the game’s art style, monster designs, and narrative are all fantastic. For fans of puzzle-platforming or gorgeous narrative aesthetic, Unbound: Worlds Apart shouldn't be missed."
2086,115,Unbound: Worlds Apart,85,Softpedia,"Aug 10, 2021","I wish that the game could have created a better shell for the entire experience. I like the look of the characters and the world, but it does need a little more variety. And the fantasy-driven story feels a little undercooked. The gameplay in Unbound: Worlds Apart is good enough to keep fans of the genre entertained, especially if they love the occasional challenge. But future titles from Alien Pixel Studios need a little more when it comes to narrative to deliver a truly great gaming experience."
2087,115,Unbound: Worlds Apart,85,MGG,"Aug  5, 2021","Unbound's graphics are undeniably one of its strengths, but that's not all the title has to offer. It's a classic and effective platformer and puzzle game that also brings a constantly renewing gameplay based on an effective concept relying on portals allowing to exploit unique and interesting physical properties. With many good ideas to support it, Unbound knows how to be exciting and addictive."
2088,115,Unbound: Worlds Apart,80,PC Games,"Oct  2, 2021","Despite being a Metroidvania in a market overflowing with games like it, Unbound manages to surprise in many different ways. It has a very interesting portal mechanic, plus an awesome soundtrack. Paired with challenging gameplay, this makes Unbound: Worlds Apart a short and neat experience."
2089,115,Unbound: Worlds Apart,80,GameOver.gr,"Aug 27, 2021","Unbound does not try to dazzle you with its visuals or gameplay ideas, but it doesn’t really need to. It’s more than enough that it provides familiar abilities albeit executed cleverly and platforming with high levels of challenge, but being fair at the same time."
2090,115,Unbound: Worlds Apart,80,Shacknews,"Aug  5, 2021","Unbound: Worlds Apart is a refreshingly original platformer, as its portal mechanic makes for some genuinely creative and challenging puzzles. The platforming is also bolstered by this same portal mechanic. The game is also quite gorgeous, thanks to its hand drawn art style. The way that the portals reveal another side of the world worked to make exploring that much more exciting. Alien Pixel Studios’ Unbound: Worlds Apart is an impressive outing from the indie developer and one of my favorites of the year so far."
2091,115,Unbound: Worlds Apart,80,PC Invasion,"Jul 29, 2021","Fairly cliché and quite short, Unbound: Worlds Apart is still well worth playing due to its excellent gameplay, controls, level design, and constant variety."
2092,115,Unbound: Worlds Apart,70,TheSixthAxis,"Oct 11, 2021","Unbound is a great puzzle platformer that takes influence from Metroidvanias without really being one itself. It focuses far more on the puzzling and a refreshingly linear path through its various environments, and the way that powers are handled prevents them from becoming boring while still leaving some room for extremely challenging optional paths. It's well worth checking out for fans of this type of game."
2093,115,Unbound: Worlds Apart,70,Gamepressure,"Sep 11, 2021",Unbound is a middle of the road platforming experience with some nice art but some rough edges when it comes to difficulty scaling and design. Unforgiving sections also hold the game back and without a great story to push you through the hard parts it winds up being a tough sell. If you’re into the Dark Souls level of challenge then go forth and platform. More casual players will want to seek out something more palatable.
2094,115,Unbound: Worlds Apart,65,Jeuxvideo.com,"Sep 20, 2021","Inspired by the greatest, Limbo and Ori and the Blind Forest to name a few, Unbound: Worlds Apart delivers a fun adventure that will keep you busy for a weekend. In particular, it offers small puzzles as well as various platform phases that are pleasant to navigate, at least initially. The rest is much less inspired, the fault of an artistic direction less and less convincing and a level-design incompatible with the different skills that Soli, our hero, accumulates as he progresses."
2095,115,Unbound: Worlds Apart,63,Riot Pixels,"Sep 12, 2021","Bad writing and repeating gameplay bring the overall experience down. You will be collecting shards and activating pillars from beginning to end. With a more polished concept, Unbound could have been so much better."

2097,116,Blue Reflection: Second Light,85,PC Invasion,"Nov  8, 2021","Reflection: Second Light is a perfect example of what a sequel should be. It takes the ideas put forward by the original and improves all of them. There's better exploration, better visuals, and, most importantly, much better character writing. The original was an average and forgettable JRPG. In contrast, Second Light is one of the best JRPGs released in recent memory."
2098,116,Blue Reflection: Second Light,81,Wccftech,"Nov 16, 2021","Blue Reflection: Second Light builds upon many of the positive aspects while updating its combat system to be accessible for a broader JRPG fan audience.

2099,116,Blue Reflection: Second Light,80,ZTGD,"Dec  6, 2021","Despite coming from a development studio that most people see as a one-series company, Blue Reflection: Second Light is a charming RPG with a clear identity of its own with a worthwhile story to tell and I’m glad I had the opportunity to check out after missing out on the original."
2100,116,Blue Reflection: Second Light,80,RPG Site,"Nov  9, 2021","Blue Reflection Second Light is a great improvement over the original and a step in the right direction for the series. Almost every feature in the original has been refined. Although there are some interesting new ideas too, not all of them are implemented well, such as the new stealth system. Second Light is not a perfect game by any means, but it is a solid title to recommend for players that want something different from big-budget JRPGs and maybe prefer a game in a relaxed environment without trying to save the world all the time."
2101,116,Blue Reflection: Second Light,80,The Mako Reactor,"Nov  8, 2021","Blue Reflection: Second Light is a great follow-up and a much better PC conversion than the original Blue Reflection. While it has some annoyances in the overall gameplay, it is a great relaxing JRPG that is worth playing if you enjoy Gust's output."
2102,116,Blue Reflection: Second Light,75,IGN Italia,"Nov  9, 2021","Blue Reflection Second Light achieves what the past episode couldn't: telling an intriguing story with a cast of compelling characters. Its light RPG mechanics leave more space for character development, toning down fan service in favour of a plot that pushes forward reconnecting all the past entries, between videogames and animated series. A sugar coated coming of age story dedicated to anime girls and fans of the ""majokko"" narrative."
2103,116,Blue Reflection: Second Light,70,Jeuxvideo.com,"Nov 28, 2021",A slower-paced J-RPG but which offers a calm and soothing experience that will especially appeal to fans of Japanese productions.
2104,116,Blue Reflection: Second Light,60,Gamepressure,"Nov 11, 2021","The second entry in the Blue Reflection series, Blue Reflection: Second Light, is great for anyone looking for a casual RPG. The combat can be slow and repetitive, and the fanservice certainly leaves a uncomfortable feeling hanging over much of the game, but underneath all that is a solid RPG with a captivating mystery at its center."
2105,117,Vesper,87,The Games Machine,"Jul 30, 2021","At a first glance you might think Vesper is something like Limbo with robots, but it's actually a great puzzle platformer with a bit of stealth. Thanks to the generous amount of checkpoints, it can be played as a casual game, a couple of screen at a time, or trying to beat the best time in a speed run, thanks to the embedded stopwatch allowing you to record and publish your game sessions without further editing. Great graphics and sound, with a gentle difficulty curve balanced by achievements not that easy to unlock. A debut with a bang for the guys from Cordens Interactive, who were able to mix a compelling story with a great gameplay."
2106,117,Vesper,83,Multiplayer.it,"Jul 30, 2021","Vesper is a charming and smart platform, with lots of good ideas and a stunning design."
2107,117,Vesper,80,Screen Rant,"Aug 10, 2021","Vesper is a highly impressive indie platformer. Its stunning visuals and mysterious game world will likely immediately hook the player, while its gameplay hits a sweet spot that will maintain that interest throughout its short runtime. It may sometimes go into comfortable spaces seen by other games in the genre, but even so there's more than enough flair here to make Vesper worthwhile."
2108,117,Vesper,80,Eurogamer Italy,"Jul 30, 2021",Vesper is a truly peculiar 2D transition adventure that encompasses its strength in simplicity and artistic achievement. Accompanying the little Seven on this introspective adventure is undoubtedly exciting and enjoyable.
2109,117,Vesper,80,IGN Italia,"Jul 30, 2021","Vesper is a little gem. On an old-fashioned (but functional) gameplay Cordens Interactive builds a work of art with great authorial value. Simple but effective puzzles and a well-constructed environmental storytelling pair with stunning art design and great sound design. Sadly stealth and puzzles are both a little too simple: it never deepens its mechanics. Knowing you don't have to expect a challenging game, it's one of the few, beautiful, Italian productions. And that's enough. Highly recommended."
2110,117,Vesper,78,SpazioGames,"Aug  2, 2021","Contemplative, smart and well design, Vesper is not perfect but will leave you in awe with its art direction and refinement."
2111,117,Vesper,78,Everyeye.it,"Jul 30, 2021","Don't be fooled by the reduced duration of Seven's adventure: after the finale you will be delighted by numerous additions during the second game, and the new awareness gained in the course of exploring Aryish could push you to renew your approach, looking for other avenues. The narration will satisfy the fans of Isaac Asimov's great science fiction, with suggestions of a religious nature that recall the works of Roger Zelazny and Philip Kindred Dick; the possibilities for in-depth analysis offered by the documents then recall works such as The Talos Principle (2014). There remain some small regrets: we would have liked a greater characterization of the inhabitants, robotic and otherwise, of the planet Aryish, and on some occasions the lack of variety of enemies leaves room for a small dose of monotony. Vesper, however, remains a star that shines bright in the sky of Italian videogame development, and which we recommend without reservation."
2112,117,Vesper,75,CD-Action,"Oct 12, 2021","Vesper is full of redundant screens that you simply run across, which made the campaign longer but at the cost of watering down the gameplay. In theory, complexity of challenges rises due to introduction of time limits, increasing number of robots and longer escape sequences, but I completed most of the game almost with my eyes closed. It’s a beautiful, atmospheric adventure, but it would definitely benefit from being a bit harder. [10/2021, p.73]"
2113,117,Vesper,60,God is a Geek,"Aug 10, 2021","It's a truly beautiful game to look at, but with slow pacing and puzzles that never really hit the mark it's hard to recommend Vesper."
2114,118,Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy,89,Ragequit.gr,"Nov  1, 2021","Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is for the most part a very enjoyable experience. A pure singleplayer title with a beefy campaign (at least 15-20 hours), smart and quality writing, great presentation and faithfulness to the universe it translates to game form."
2115,118,Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy,85,PC Invasion,"Oct 25, 2021","The plot meanders and the game is somewhat too long, but it's still a great time and well worth experiencing for Guardians fans."

2118,118,Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy,80,Multiplayer.it,"Nov  8, 2021","Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy on PC performs very well. It is the best version on a purely aesthetic level. The work done by Eidos to recreate the galaxy, the planets and its protagonists is incredible."
2119,118,Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy,80,Jeuxvideo.com,"Oct 26, 2021","With its endearing characters and effective humor, Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the pleasant surprises of the end of the year, which is obviously aimed at a very large audience. Behind this careful writing, we feel a deep love on the part of the developers of Eidos Montreal for its marginalized space. And if the adventure is not as epic as we hoped, the journey is nonetheless pleasant with its moments of complicity and the many choices offered which reinforce the player's involvement. A truly attractive journey, in particular thanks to an efficient and fluid combat system which nevertheless shows its limits at the end of the game and against the bosses. Finally, it is more on its visual part that the title can divide. If we find on the one hand original environments and neat character models, we also note the presence of less convincing facial animations in places and sometimes less fine landscapes. It is nonetheless a gripping adventure alongside the galaxy's greatest magnificent losers that has plenty to please MCU fans."
2120,118,Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy,80,Wccftech,"Oct 25, 2021","Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is a highly enjoyable action/adventure romp that never strays from the beaten path. You won't find any major experiments or innovations here, but you will experience a great adaptation of the beloved dysfunctional team of galactic superheroes. The story and characters are well written, the combat is fun (if perhaps a bit too easy), and the audio is excellent."
2121,118,Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy,75,MGG,"Oct 25, 2021","More than a mainstream game for fans, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is a real hit that wasn't expected. Of course, being a fan of Star Lord and Rocket's humour will help you enjoy the game, but the single-player adventure offered by Eidos Montreal can suit anyone who likes the genre. A successful art direction, a pleasing energy, omnipresent dialogues and music plus dynamic fights make this new title an explosive condensation of good things succeeding in making us forget the few negative points such as a certain slowness in some chapters and the impossibility to embody the other guardians."
2122,118,Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy,70,Merlin'in Kazanı (Turkey),"Nov  1, 2021","Imagine watching this movie for 15 hours. Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy makes a great impression at first, but as you pass time, it makes you feel like it's a monotonous game."
2123,118,Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy,70,PCGamesN,"Oct 25, 2021","Guardians of the Galaxy mostly nails the quirky tone and characters that Marvel fans will be hoping for.

2126,119,Jupiter Hell,90,RPG Fan,"Aug 31, 2021","I could go on and on about all of the other bells and whistles, like the importance of spending multitools wisely at upgrade terminals, the incredible procedural generation of the levels and enemies, the more than a dozen modes to play, all of the in-game achievements to earn, and the plentiful secrets, but those are best discovered when you buy this game. If you’ve got a strategic bone in your body, you have to buy this. Go, buy it now. It’s $25 at full price, which might as well be an act of charity considering the quantity and quality of what you’re getting."
2127,119,Jupiter Hell,90,Screen Rant,"Aug 15, 2021","While there is definitely room for improvement, Jupiter Hell is one of those Early Access projects that really used its time well. Two years of development make this finished product feel like a polished and definitive roguelike experience. Imminently approachable and nostalgically fulfilling, Jupiter Hell slays all expectations and provides a potent combination of action and strategy that shouldn't be missed. Everyone from veteran rogues to boomer shooter diehards will find something to appreciate in these bloodstained halls."
2128,119,Jupiter Hell,90,God is a Geek,"Aug  5, 2021",Jupiter Hell is a thrilling turn-based roguelike with stripped back mechanics that make every playthrough more exciting than the last.
2129,119,Jupiter Hell,85,GameCritics,"Sep  9, 2021","With its fast pace and emphasis on explosive action, Jupiter Hell is a more-than-welcome addition to the ranks of the roguelike genre. Even without the nods to its better-known brethren, it still packs quite a wallop. It isn’t perfect, but I loved blasting demons and zombified minions too much to care. Now, where is that chainsaw?"
2130,119,Jupiter Hell,85,Softpedia,"Aug 20, 2021","Sure, the story is nothing impressive. There are moments when the generated levels do not make too much sense. Progress sometimes hinges on the placement of one health chest or one group of enemies. But, despite the randomness, Jupiter Hell feels fair and there’s a lot of depth to discover in this surprising mix."
2131,119,Jupiter Hell,82,COGconnected,"Aug  9, 2021","One could make a long list of things that Jupiter Hell isn’t, but that would be missing the point and the prize. Jupiter Hell is an easy-to-understand, but challenging and addictive roguelike, with turn-based action that never gets bogged down with the minutiae of facing, hexes, grids, or overly-complex mechanics. Instead, it zeroes in on cover, position, tactics, and the smart use of the tools at hand. The procedurally generated elements are the stuff of hit and miss, luck of the draw, run-ending frustration, and occasionally some pretty barren levels. Aside from that, Jupiter Hell is a focused and fun homage to an era of shooter where you never knew what was around the next dark corner."
2132,119,Jupiter Hell,81,Vandal,"Sep  7, 2021","Jupiter Hell is a great tribute to Doom and other games from the 90s with new and well implemented additions like turn-based RPG, roguelike and survival."
2133,119,Jupiter Hell,81,IGN Italia,"Aug  5, 2021","Doom meets the roguelike genre and the result is a very fine game, proving that the demonic invasions and sci-fi atmosphere of id Software's masterpiece can work wonders even with a totally different gameplay."
2134,119,Jupiter Hell,80,DarkZero,"Aug 31, 2021","Jupiter Hell is made for people who might not normally enjoy roguelikes or for people who have played the modern take on the genre and want a game that goes back to the old school rulebook, but brings with it some looter shooter, straight to the point, action."
2135,119,Jupiter Hell,80,NME,"Aug  9, 2021","It says a lot that Jupiter Hell – a turn-based roguelike where mistakes end your entire run – can whisk your cautious sensibilities into an unadulterated blood frenzy at the drop of a shell. The game is a must-have for strategy fans and curious Doom fans alike – the unique pacing brings something new to the turn-based genre, while demon-slaying hobbyists will find that Jupiter Hell scratches the same itch for satanic butchering as all the greats. There’s some work to be done on stability – and more variance in builds wouldn’t go amiss – but Jupiter Hell is an incredible, hell-bound slaughter as it stands."
2136,119,Jupiter Hell,80,Noisy Pixel,"Aug  5, 2021","Jupiter Hell doesn’t need the word Doom in the title to make an impact, but it’s commendable how well it presents DRL through modern design. At its heart, it’s a turn-based dungeon-crawler RPG, but that doesn’t calm my nerves when I’m blasting through a hallway of enemies from around the corner with more approaching from behind. This game’s launch version is serviceable, but the lack of enemy variety will leave your first hours of gameplay feeling repetitive in some areas. Still, it’s clear that there’s more on the way for this standout roguelike experience, and I’m all here for it."
2137,119,Jupiter Hell,77,The Games Machine,"Aug  5, 2021","Solid, no-nonsense roguelike with a comparatively rare sci-fi setting. Too bad it doesn’t deliver the badass power fantasy that its inspiring material source (Doom) does so well."

2139,119,Jupiter Hell,73,Everyeye.it,"Aug  8, 2021","Jupiter Hell is a richer, more concrete and more enjoyable version of Doom, the Roguelike, from which it borrows the original concept. The result is a more than valid exponent of the genre, which mixes action, strategy and a pinch of RPG without ever being too frustrating, thanks to a good balance and the ability to select different levels of challenge."
2140,119,Jupiter Hell,70,GamingTrend,"Sep 14, 2021","Jupiter Hell isn’t afraid to wear its inspirations on its sleeve, and it does a great job in recreating that ‘DOOM’ feeling in a vastly different genre. While the build and class diversity is solid at first glance, the lack of gameplay and level variety doesn’t provide that ‘one more run’ feeling. That being said, there is plenty for hardcore strategists to sink their teeth into should they want to master the game at the highest difficulty."
2141,119,Jupiter Hell,70,TheSixthAxis,"Sep  7, 2021","Jupiter Hell is a tactical roguelike that is sure to find its fans, but will turn others away with its high difficulty and overly random reeling to each run. The lack of iterative improvements between runs made every failure feel overly punishing, though that's common in the with roguelikes. The end result is a game that I can appreciate, but didn’t really enjoy. Your mileage may vary of course, and if the idea of a fusion of Doom and XCOM appeals, then this may well be the game for you."
2142,119,Jupiter Hell,70,Metro GameCentral,"Aug  9, 2021","A turn-based roguelike set in a universe that’s similar to but legally distinct from Doom, and where every choice you make has immediate and long term consequences."
2143,119,Jupiter Hell,58,Player 2,"Aug 19, 2021","As a Roguelike, Jupiter Hell stumbles with the randomness that shakes up each run instead, allowing the player a lot of control over how they want to build their character. Despite this, there is fun to be had with the tactical shooter."

Be it gliding across clouds, grinding on rails to jump between buildings, or sneaking up on and successfully slashing at the one wall-based creature that fires lasers at you, virtually everything here is an absolute joy to experience. This is easily one of the year’s most captivating games, and one to not miss out on."
2145,120,Solar Ash,90,Checkpoint Gaming,"Dec  1, 2021","I’ve fallen in love with Solar Ash. It proves to be one of the best recent action-adventure games with a stunning sci-fi world, rich with bits of lore and worldbuilding to unravel. It may have come just under the wire in terms of 2021 releases, but it’s still a game that’s a must-play. Step on in and you have an experience with none of the fat and all of the glory. Gameplay that feels fluid and satisfying, moments and cinematography that feel like paintings of art, a story that resolves in an impacting way… this game has it all. Heart Machine you’ve bloody done it again."

2147,120,Solar Ash,85,Noisy Pixel,"Dec  8, 2021","Solar Ash is a delightful experience boasting a continually engaging gameplay loop coupled with enticing sound design and narrative beats. Even with its oddly paced story, problematic camera, and occasionally dull boss battle implementation, it’s a joyous, memorable game that any intrigued party should dive into. Moreover, its digestible gameplay length and ambitious voice quality go a long way into making this a standout title of the year."
2148,120,Solar Ash,81,The Games Machine,"Dec  8, 2021","When you want to get rid quickly of level bosses just so you can get back to running down ramps and trampolines, there is something amiss with the balance of the game. And this is exactly the issue with Solar Ash: common enemies aren’t a big threat and boss battles break the flow, and not a in a great way. Exploring the game's bizarre worlds, on the other hand, is extremely fun, and requires above average amounts of skill and timing. If you are looking for a fast-paced 3D action platformer that also offers a good story, Solar Ash is a solid choice."
2149,120,Solar Ash,80,Meristation,"Dec 31, 2021","Solar Ash has matchless richness and fun offering full design variety, verticality moreover proposing ideas, concepts and diverse moments which will never get you tired of."
2150,120,Solar Ash,80,Shacknews,"Dec  9, 2021","Solar Ash is another hugely stylish venture from Heart Machine, though it’s not terribly long. Exploring any area to its fullest ran me about two to four hours and the whole thing ran about 11 hours for me when it was all said and done. Nonetheless, the graceful feel of movement, platforming, and combat in this game can’t be denied, and it’s accompanied by a lush and interesting mix of neon, natural, and industrial landscapes caught up in Solar Ash’s Voidspace. There’s a little jank in the controls here at here, but generally, for such a quick game, Solar Ash glides like a cosmic dream."
2151,120,Solar Ash,80,GAMINGbible,"Dec  6, 2021","For the most part Solar Ash's impeccable style more than makes up for its weaknesses. The Ultravoid is a stunning prog-rock album cover come to life, and skating through it to uncovering its many secrets is rarely anything other than a complete joy. If it were a little longer, I fear its flaws would have become too much to ignore. But at a brisk seven-hours, Solar Ash is a perfectly paced adventure that's well worth your time."
2152,120,Solar Ash,80,NME,"Dec  2, 2021","Full of inventive locations to explore and various creative methods in which to do it, Solar Ash is a mesmerising intergalactic 3D platformer that ends up being greater than the sum of its parts. The mission structure may be a tad repetitive, but it’s easily forgivable the moment you find yourself grinding down a rail into the next neon-soaked cityscape under the shadow of a black hole."
2153,120,Solar Ash,80,Jeuxvideo.com,"Dec  2, 2021","Rich in a singular aura and delicious journeys, Solar Ash is home to a universe that must be patiently tamed to be fully appreciated; between the so comfortable walks there are some great difficulties to overcome. From top to bottom, the cosmic and complex regions built by Heart Machine make one want to be fully excavated. Too bad that each new panorama discovered shelters objectives which often fail to disorient us."
2154,120,Solar Ash,80,PC Invasion,"Dec  1, 2021","An endearing experience with a well-integrated narrative, Solar Ash trades the action of its predecessor for speed-based platforming. It's a compelling play, but it feels a little light."
2155,120,Solar Ash,80,GameSpot,"Dec  1, 2021","There's a reason this space is so dreamily built--Solar Ash takes place inside a massive black hole, after all--but the game is at its best when it isn't treating those reasons as if they matter all that much. The late game leans a little too heavily into the story, including swapping out the strong boss battles in favor of a binary choice in the game's climactic moments. But, most of the time, that story is where it belongs: in the background. And, thankfully, Solar Ash has some gorgeous backgrounds."

And that results in a rock-solid game, not least because of its scale. In the game, you lead your people through the different eras of our civilization. At six different times you are presented with ten cultures that you can take over from then on. In addition, the characteristics of your previous choices are preserved, resulting in a unique melting pot of influences from a million (!) possible combinations. Each game is different, and you will spend many hours exploring only a fraction of the possibilities. That replayability alone makes Humankind more than worth its money."

This is the new standard for 4X historical games. It is an absolute must-play for fans of the genre and has finally knocked Firaxis off its throne as the king of the hill."

The core of the 4X gameplay is easy to understand but hard to master, with a very big possibility space. The main selling point, moving through civilizations as history progresses, creates plenty of potential for cool stories, overpowered empires, and surprising twists. But the overall experience sometimes feels like less than the sum of its parts. Amplitude has such a reputation for creating unique civilizations and mechanics that I expected more."

This 4X game (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) takes the main ideas from Civilization, and Amplitude Studios blends them with the city-building and clean, pretty UIs of its Endless series."
2179,121,Humankind,80,COGconnected,"Aug 31, 2021","Humankind is a solid, if not especially revelatory, take on what has become a pretty ossified genre. Its changes — in particular the opening Neolithic stage, and its combat systems — are not dramatic shifts, but they are enough to make an experienced 4X player pay attention.

2183,121,Humankind,80,IGN France,"Aug 18, 2021","A nice take on the 4X Civ-like kind of strategy from Amplitude, already experienced in the genre. But it feels too safe, to cautious, and it reminds of the first Endless Space, and huge gap crossed by Endless Space 2.

While it does not avoid the pitfalls of many 4Xs, with parts that sometimes drag on or balance issues, it remains a refreshing take on the genre, which can be a nice gateway for newcomers. The veterans, for their part, will certainly perceive the shadow of Civilization which hangs a little too intensely over the aura of Humankind, but they will undoubtedly appreciate its originality and the multiple tactical approaches, for parts which they will follow without displeasing. . Humankind is undoubtedly a game that will gain depth and longevity over time, Amplitude being known to be attentive to community feedback and take care of the follow-up of its games."

Technically, the game is robust, with nice graphics and music, and above all, it has the advantage of being relatively accessible to new players with its tutorials, its clear and accessible mechanics, as well as a limited micromanagement requirement. It should also appeal to veterans of the genre looking for a more tactical management of conflicts. With a bit of content and some additional polish, it has great potential in the long run."

If you’ve played an historical strategy game before, don’t make the mistake of thinking you know how this will play out.

2206,121,Humankind,70,Trusted Reviews,"Aug 31, 2021","I had a lot of fun with Humankind, with its deep city building mechanics keeping me glued to the screen for hours on end. But with its unique multi-culture mechanic failing to improve upon solid foundations set by other turn-based titles, I’m unsure why anyone would choose to play Humankind over the likes of Civilization VI. That said, with a fantastic combat system and its unique core concept, Humankind has lots of potential to develop into a more competitive title in the strategy genre, so keep an eye out for future updates and DLC."
2207,121,Humankind,70,Gamer.nl,"Aug 30, 2021","Though clearly inspired by Sid Meier’s Civilization, Humankind is a very unique experience. Especially the first phase of gameplay, spent discovering and claiming land is refreshing. The game gradually loses some steam, but remains fascinating because of it’s many intricate mechanics. We hope that those mechanics will come into their own with the upcoming patches. Development wise, Humankind is still one or two turns away from being a thoroughly engaging game."
2208,121,Humankind,70,New Game Network,"Aug 24, 2021",Humankind is a decent 4X entry for fans of the genre looking for something different - and yet very familiar. Newcomers are probably better off trying Civilization and giving Humankind some time to address its issues.
2209,121,Humankind,70,Twinfinite,"Aug 20, 2021","Humankind is still an exciting evolution for the genre. Its dedication to historical authenticity sets it apart from its largest competitor, and the new systems like war support and shifting cultures feel like the very first steps leading to something that’s potentially greater.

It strays a little too close to Civilization at times, but its unique take on the advancement of culture and ideology prevents it from feeling like a copycat. The way your culture changes between eras means that no two games will ever be the same, no matter how much you try. It’s not quite as masterful as it could be and needs some fine-tuning in some areas, but it remains a solid addition to Amplitude’s library of strategy games."

2215,121,Humankind,60,GameSpot,"Aug 25, 2021","From the faint outlines of religion to the background hum of influence, from the awkward city-building to the cumbersome tactical combat, all wrapped up in a cultural system that struggles to imprint a strong identity on your empire, Humankind strains under the weight of too many complex systems that too often find themselves colliding rather than coalescing. By turns disjointed and confounding, Humankind is nonetheless fascinating, at least to this experienced 4X strategy player, even if I couldn't say I truly enjoyed it."
2216,122,Wytchwood,90,Screen Rant,"Dec 13, 2021","While less carefree than simulation titles like Animal Crossing or Stardew Valley, the casual pacing and nonchalant nature of the main character make Wytchwood a great pick for relaxing exploration-style games. It is also a great choice for those who enjoy crafting and survival games, but prefer to have questlines to follow instead of self-governed gameplay. While the 2D art style is fun and reminiscent of storybook illustrations, this game is likely not the best pick for younger players due to questlines dealing with horror elements, as well as graphic depictions of animal death when using traps and lures. However, fans of twisted fairytales and creepy magical plotlines will likely find Wytchwood an enjoyable and spine-tingling experience."

Wytchwood made my bog witch dreams come true, and if you love a good fetch quest game, I’m positive this will be your cup of witches’ brew too."
2220,122,Wytchwood,75,MGG,"Jan  5, 2022","Rather short (about 10 hours to finish the main story), Wytchwood is a very good crafting game with a fantastic art direction and an excellent soundtrack promoting relaxation. The puzzles and fights present may not be complex enough, but the whole thing is lifted by finding different resources in various biomes and crafting unique items."
2221,122,Wytchwood,75,Multiplayer.it,"Dec 16, 2021",Wytchwood shares much with its context. The small team of AlienTrap Games managed to create a powerful game that is capable to obscure the derivative nature of its origins. The only guilt that can be attributed to this project is that it wasn't able to determine when it was the right time to put an end to its story.
2222,122,Wytchwood,75,GameCritics,"Dec 16, 2021","I’m used to crafting-themed games being huge, sprawling, self-guided odysseys, so compared to them, Wytchwood is a bite-sized revelation. It’s bleak, it’s funny, and it has character for days. By focusing on the story and puzzles, it creates an item-focused adventure that rarely wastes the player’s time, and then gets out on one heck of a high note. This one is a truly charming adventure that’s as gruesome as it is sweet."
2223,122,Wytchwood,66,COGconnected,"Dec 17, 2021","To be clear, there’s a lot of space in this world for gentle, low-impact games. Wytchwood isn’t a bad game because it’s easier than Dark Souls. Difficulty is not the only reason to play a game. But Wytchwood does let the player down with such a vague and uninteresting story. A game needs a hook, and this story ain’t it. Crafting games make me uniquely aware of how much time I am wasting by playing them. But in the end, I like to look back at the little work of art I made by building a house, or a city, or a space station. In Wytchwood I am just collecting ingredients because the game told me to collect those ingredients. It’s an attractive enough game, but it needs something else substantial."

2227,123,Hot Wheels Unleashed,85,Hooked Gamers,"Oct  1, 2021","I enjoyed Hot Wheels Unleashed a lot more than I expected to, and it'll likely be my go-to pick-up-and-play racer for the foreseeable future. The game plays well, looks great, and has enough customization options to keep things fresh."
2228,123,Hot Wheels Unleashed,80,Destructoid,"Sep 27, 2021","Hot Wheels Unleashed impressed me on basically every marker. It looks terrific, it feels great, and the track design is extremely well done. I kind of hate the blind box approach of unlocking cars, but that’s a small complaint when getting my wheels on the track is always a delight."
2229,123,Hot Wheels Unleashed,78,New Game Network,"Oct  5, 2021","Hot Wheels Unleashed is an enjoyable arcade racer with deep customization and great presentation, let down by a lack of modes to play."
2230,123,Hot Wheels Unleashed,77,SpazioGames,"Sep 27, 2021","Despite some aspects of the game feel more improvable than others, Hot Wheels Unleashed is without a doubt the best game ever made about the toy cars made by Mattel."
2231,123,Hot Wheels Unleashed,77,The Games Machine,"Sep 27, 2021","Although driving is super fun, the design of the career mode feels boring and samey after the first hour. Hopefully the multiplayer will be able to lend the game some more longevity."
2232,123,Hot Wheels Unleashed,75,GameStar,"Oct 13, 2021","Pure arcade racing fun that properly captures the charm of the Hot
Wheels brand. Track editor shortcomings and an expensive Day-One DLC are
however bothersome."
2233,123,Hot Wheels Unleashed,75,GamingTrend,"Oct 12, 2021","Hot Wheels Unleashed is a competent enough racer, but lacks anything to make it unique compared to previous games. It’s generally very bland, relies on loot boxes, and the AI rubber bands constantly."
2234,123,Hot Wheels Unleashed,75,MGG,"Sep 28, 2021","With Hot Wheels Unleashed, the Mattel brand succeeds in its return to video games with a dynamic title, easy to handle, fluid and really fun. Everything breathes the Hot Wheels spirit and that's good. Despite a feeling of repetitiveness linked to the use of only 5 environments, it contains a lot of good ideas and often gives you a good feeling, especially during the boss races. We would have liked a less redundant soundtrack and a more advanced story mode, but it still manages to do well. As for the collectors, they will be delighted to chase the rare pearl, even if the surprise box option and its random dimension are highly debatable."
2235,123,Hot Wheels Unleashed,70,PC Games,"Oct 12, 2021","Hot Wheels Unleashed could have been such a great game, but wasted his potential. Basically, it’s a fun arcade racer with an interesting setting which it barely uses in interesting ways. Also, the multiplayer is broken. Nevertheless, despite its flaws, Hot Wheels Unleashed is a fun racing game. Just don’t expect anything extraordinary."
2236,123,Hot Wheels Unleashed,70,DarkZero,"Oct 11, 2021","The track editor is brilliant, enabling people to go delirious with imagination, though sadly, sharing these creations is hindered by the poor UI and filtering options. I also dislike the concept behind blind boxes, it is just not a good way to unlock more cars, too many dupes for it to be anything other than frustrating. Apart from those cons, I have good words for Hot Wheels Unleashed. This is a solid recommendation for anyone who enjoys arcade racers, especially ones that go more for skill and speed over the randomness of power-ups."
2237,123,Hot Wheels Unleashed,70,Jeuxvideo.com,"Sep 27, 2021","It remains an effective game, quite enjoyable and is without doubt the one that most faithfully respects the spirit of the famous brand, with that same nostalgic and passionate vision that we could have had ourselves, a few years earlier."
2238,123,Hot Wheels Unleashed,65,PC Invasion,"Sep 27, 2021","Hot Wheels Unleashed has a lot of good concepts and ideas that are sullied by awkward execution and weird design choices. Its physics could use some more fine-tuning, and its AI needs to be rebalanced, along with a revamped track builder. Yet, there's still some glimmer to its toy car shine."
2239,123,Hot Wheels Unleashed,65,Gamepressure,"Sep 27, 2021","Hot Wheels Unleashed is a pure arcade racer. Drift on corners, push boost on straights, be first on the finish line – these are the principles. It is as simple as it is fun. With great sense of speed, fierce competitors, and twisted track designs, races are dynamic, vigorous, and exciting… At least during the first three hours."
2240,124,Roguebook,100,Gamers Heroes,"Jun 15, 2021","Roguebook has everything it needs to set the genre on fire. A gorgeous visual feast, combat as deep and challenging as any CCG, rewarding roguelike mechanics - it has it all. If you're a fan of the genre, this one is quickly setting up to be a GOTY contender."
2241,124,Roguebook,90,DarkZero,"Jul  1, 2021","Really it comes down to this; if you like deck-builders or ever have, you should give Roguebook a chance. Tainted Grail: Conquest isn’t for everyone and I knew that right away, even if I loved that game in its own way. Roguebook is one that everyone with even a passing interest should try. You may get your ass kicked but I doubt you’ll regret it."
2242,124,Roguebook,90,Gaming Nexus,"Jun 23, 2021","I am a sucker for this very type roguelike deck building game, and in RogueBook I have found a worthy successor to my favorite in the space, Slay the Spire. While I might think Slay the Spire has that edge on the given mechanics and strategies of a single run, I believe RogueBook excels at world building, game progression, and re-playablity as new power-ups, characters, cards, map items, and challenges are unlocked not just on every run but especially after successfully completing the core game. Each is excellent, each game deserves to be enjoyed. To prefer one over the other is to prefer chocolate syrup over caramel, but in both you are treated to a delicious dessert of fun and strategic gaming."
2243,124,Roguebook,90,Hey Poor Player,"Jun 22, 2021","Honestly, I have very little criticism for Roguebook. You can feel the inspiration from earlier deck-builders, but it’s very much its own thing. Unique combat mechanics, gorgeous visuals, and addicting exploration make for a roguelike deck-builder that’s polished and keeps you going back for more."
2244,124,Roguebook,88,Impulsegamer,"Jun 23, 2021","Roguebook is a solid game with strong Card battle elements with a twist of RPG, and a slice of tabletop mixed in. Who would have thought it would be so addictive? I should have known, with company names Abrakam and Nacon, which already sound like prescription drugs. Yea, I am now thoroughly addicted to Rougebook."
2245,124,Roguebook,85,CD-Action,"Sep  1, 2021","I like a lot about Roguebook: the combat system that gives you loads of possibilities despite being simple; revealing the map through ""painting” it with brushes and ink that you find along the way; enhancing your cards with crystals that modify their effects. You just feel it’s not a debut project but a very solid game created by developers who have card-based gameplay down to a science. [09/2021, p.50]"
2246,124,Roguebook,85,GameCritics,"Jul 19, 2021","It’s easy to think that the run-based deckbuilder genre has been entirely tapped out, but Roguebook counters that notion in an instant. Though its broader narrative and post-game balance may be a little thin, everything else between these pages is incredibly rich and satisfying. By combining the elegance of tabletop map exploration with a thoughtful evolution of deckbuilding mechanics, Abrakam and Richard Garfield have found a match made for the history books."
2247,124,Roguebook,80,God is a Geek,"Jul 16, 2021","Roguebook is an interesting deckbuilder that does a lot of things well. It doesn’t do a great deal that feels new and exciting, but there are flashes of brilliance here and there."
2248,124,Roguebook,80,Multiplayer.it,"Jul 12, 2021",Roguebook is a very classic card-based rogue-lite that is also very solid. The gameplay is quite free and the sense of progression is great.
2249,124,Roguebook,80,Het Nieuwsblad,"Jul  5, 2021","Roguebook follows the success formula of other toppers in this crossover of genres such as Slay the spire and Monster train. Don't be fooled by the simple graphics. Under the hood is a layered role-playing game with plenty of room for personalization, allowing you to create your own play style. The game is not revolutionary but it is rock solid, especially for this soft price."
2250,124,Roguebook,80,GameSpew,"Jun 25, 2021","Like other great roguelikes, the more of Roguebook you play, the more you want to play. Each death is simply a nudge to continue; to assess your strategy and try something new. Exploring the game’s world is a joy, and combat is easy to get to grips with while still being deep and engaging. There’s a lot to love here, all wrapped up in a package of sumptuous art."
2251,124,Roguebook,80,Softpedia,"Jun 17, 2021","Roguebook is a competent game, both a good and a bad thing to be in the crowded rogue and card game spaces. For a newcomer, this is a solid entry-point, with engaging battles, a good long-term progression, and an interesting way to explore. For someone who has played the obvious inspirations the ink-linked ideas are not innovative enough. The team at Abrakam was too conservative in its approach. The game needs more weirdness and more tweaks to the battle formula to stand out. If they get the chance to create another Roguebook experience they need to take the good bones of this game and then push the entire genre forward in some way."
2252,124,Roguebook,80,TheSixthAxis,"Jun 17, 2021","Roguebook is a game that will feel crushingly familiar at first, but reveals itself to be more nuanced and interesting the more you play it. It's definitely a fun game, and while it feels like there have been more original roguelike deckbuilders recently, Roguebook is still good fun, and there's enough here to keep you going for a long time if it clicks with you."
2253,124,Roguebook,80,PC Invasion,"Jun 16, 2021","If you have the patience, Roguebook is an interesting adventure, worth exploring. Players will be treated to a multifaceted strategy title, that keeps you guessing constantly. Why not have them deal you a hand?"
2254,124,Roguebook,80,Checkpoint Gaming,"Jun 15, 2021","Roguebook is a refreshing take on traditional card games. With its original map and combat mechanics, it delivers engaging roguelike elements that keep things interesting run after run. While the game might not contain the world’s most ground-breaking story, card game aficionados are sure to find something to their liking in this Faeria-themed release."
2255,124,Roguebook,78,PC Gamer,"Jun 21, 2021","Roguebook stands out from the pack on a few qualities, but it's not a must-play."
2256,124,Roguebook,75,KeenGamer,"Jul  8, 2021","The latest in a series of games trying to find the next winning iteration of the roguelike deckbuilding genre, Roguebook has all the character and charm it needs to avoid being just another Slay the Spire clone. Introducing fresh and interesting new mechanics it proves to be a good addition to the genre, but not quite an amazing one."
2257,124,Roguebook,71,COGconnected,"Jun 16, 2021","If you’re looking for something new to play and are a fan of roguelike card games, then you’ll probably have a good time with Roguebook. It’s a fun game and does a solid job of being what it is – when it works that is. However, if you’re looking for the next big genre-defying roguelike then you might be a bit disappointed as Roguebook isn’t really that. It is a good game, just not an incredible one and maybe that’s enough."
2258,124,Roguebook,70,IGN,"Jul 14, 2021","Roguebook’s positional gameplay makes for a really fun combat puzzle, but the downside of the two hero system is that player strategy feels less focused than the best the genre has to offer. I enjoyed trying to combine hero abilities in unexpected ways, but the bespoke hero mechanics often weren’t compelling enough to really elevate that. Even so, Roguebook is an entertaining new take on the deck-builder genre, and its new ideas and lovingly realised world make it well worth a look."
2259,124,Roguebook,70,PC Games,"Jun 28, 2021","Roguebook is, as the name may have already told you, a rouge-like deckbuilding game situated in the World of Faeria. Despite treading old ground, Roguebook does a lot of things right and different. Sadly, there is just too little of it to entertain for more than a few hours. Some technical hiccups also downgrade the experience."
2260,124,Roguebook,70,Screen Rant,"Jun 15, 2021","Errors aside, though, Roguebook is still an exceptionally fun experience. It's a very good deckbuilding game hiding within an innovative take on roguelike play, and the charm of its characters and the accessibility of its difficulty will go a long way in compelling people to give it a try. A deeper story, more variety in levels and characters, and some crucial bug fixes would go a long way in giving Roguebook long-lasting appeal, but it's still well-worth checking out for fans of either roguelikes or deckbuilders - as long as they can stomach a few crashes and don't mind a bit of an easier experience than they may be used to."
2261,124,Roguebook,65,The Indie Game Website,"Jun 17, 2021","The pull of “just one more run” is the heart of roguelikes, but lacking even that makes Roguebook little more than just a distraction from better games. Like the junk food you eat between real meals or while bored, it’s enjoyable at times, but will ultimately leave you hungry for something more substantial."
2262,124,Roguebook,60,NME,"Jun 22, 2021","Roguebook layers lots of complex systems on top of each other, which is sadly a double-edged sword as you feel simultaneously powerful and also completely out of control. It’s a classic case of adding a few too many ideas into an already stuffed experience, until the experience is more akin to a buffet than a tightly presented three-course meal."
2263,124,Roguebook,50,Cubed3,"Aug 23, 2021","To be clear, this is actually really fun and interesting, but at this point it was not ready for release. There are far too many literal game-breaking bugs and errors that freeze RogueBook solid. The second level alone took over 10 reloads to beat. With some patches and balances though, this game could easy be a recommended to CCG or strategy players."

By erasing the flaws of the previous expansion, Doom Eternal: The Ancient Gods, Part II offers the most complete games of the series. The new enemies are integrated very well and create new well thought out challenges. Apart from its lifespan, which can be explained by its release model, this new content has nothing to envy to the base game and closes the saga of the Doom Slayer with panache."
2267,125,DOOM Eternal: The Ancient Gods Part Two,80,CD-Action,"Nov 15, 2021","It’s a worthy finale to Slayer’s gory odyssey, but I must admit that while Part One left me hungry for more, I was a bit tired by the end of Part Two.

2268,125,DOOM Eternal: The Ancient Gods Part Two,80,IGN,"Mar 23, 2021","Thanks to its continued evolution of Doom Eternal’s already-brilliant formula, I enjoyed The Ancient Gods Part 2 a bit more than Part 1. While it is a bummer that you only get to ride that sweet dragon in cutscenes, the new enemies prove to be more fun to fight, the Sentinel Hammer is a blast, and the final boss fight isn’t quite as sadistic. You’ll still need mastery of every skill Doom has taught you over the past half-decade to make it through this gauntlet, and if this is the end of Eternal’s story, it’s been a hell of a ride."
2269,125,DOOM Eternal: The Ancient Gods Part Two,80,PC Games,"Mar 22, 2021","All things considered, Part Two offers a satisfying conclusion to the Doom saga, with amazing combat, beautiful levels, a new weapon to play with and one epic set piece towards the end. It's also more balanced and manageable than the first DLC. The final boss fight is my only real complaint: What should have been a pulse-pounding battle for the ages, is essentially an overlong dodgefest that just drags on and on without challenge or excitement."
2270,125,DOOM Eternal: The Ancient Gods Part Two,75,XGN,"Apr  8, 2021","DOOM Eternal The Ancient Gods Part Two is a great finale story-wise, but when it comes to gameplay it is rather disappointing. The few new enemies and mechanics feel shallow and the actual final boss fight is a flop compared to what we've gotten in Eternal and the previous installment of DOOM. So just like Doomguy, we'll patiently have to wait until we can get going again because there's an itch that needs scratching."

Short and lacking interesting enemies, the second DLC of DOOM Eternal doesn't offer enough to justify its price. If you are interested in learning what happens to the Slayer after the end of the base game’s campaign, you’re better off waiting for a nice discount."
2273,125,DOOM Eternal: The Ancient Gods Part Two,74,Everyeye.it,"Mar 22, 2021","The overall quality of the package still stands at more than good levels, just enough to deliver to the players an epilogue worthy of the legend of the Doom Slayer."
2274,125,DOOM Eternal: The Ancient Gods Part Two,70,Cubed3,"Mar 22, 2021","The Ancient Gods - Part Two is very good… or, more precisely, just very good. Compared to the near flawless core game, and the slightly rough around the edges, but still great Part One, this feels kind of rushed, with the new additions once again following the tired formula of gimmicky enemies. As for the story, and most importantly, the presentation, it's a blatant mess. A disappointing one at that, as this isn't just a simple expansion, but the culmination of what was basically the resurrection of the venerable franchise that 2016's DOOM initiated."
2275,125,DOOM Eternal: The Ancient Gods Part Two,45,GameCritics,"May 25, 2021","This underwhelming finale to the rebooted Doom saga would be limp enough when judged on its own merits, but the fact that the developers went back and screwed around with what made The Ancient Gods, Part One work so well is criminal. This expansion is more Doom Eternal, which should be a good thing, but turns out to be the weakest and most disappointing that Doom Eternal has ever been."

2277,126,Fights in Tight Spaces,90,Shacknews,"Dec  2, 2021","The best thing I can say about Fights in Tight Spaces is that it's so easy to get lost in a run. You can start this game at 7 or 8 p.m. and it'll be midnight before you even know what's what. It takes a special kind of game for me to lay in bed overnight thinking about what my strategy will be the next day, but this one has done that. It's one of the best indie titles this year and will probably go down as one of my favorite roguelikes ever by the time this secret agent sits down to have his martini."
2278,126,Fights in Tight Spaces,90,TheSixthAxis,"Dec  2, 2021",Fights in Tight Spaces is a really unique and stylish take on the deck building genre with a level of strategy on offer that will be enough to keep people coming back for a long time. Fights in Tight Spaces is worth your attention.
2279,126,Fights in Tight Spaces,90,Finger Guns,"Dec  2, 2021","A fantastic blend of turn based strategy, deck builder and roguelike games, Fights In Tight Spaces belongs among the best these genres has to offer. With a minimalistic art style that underpins a vast tactical depth, FITS is accessible, deeply engrossing and is one of the most slickly designed games I’ve played in 2021. An easy recommendation."
2280,126,Fights in Tight Spaces,83,Player 2,"Dec 22, 2021",If you are a fan of either roguelike’s and deck-builders or just a fan of martial arts in general then I recommend giving this a try.  There is nothing sweeter than a flawless victory over multiple opponents.

It’s perfect for those new to deck-builders or for genre veterans who crave something with a different flair. Fighting game enthusiasts will enjoy the take on strategic brawls that don’t skimp on the style. As for everyone else? Who can say no to glorious aesthetics and surprisingly cerebral gameplay in a bloody beatdown package? Definitely give Fights in Tight Spaces a shot — it’s a knockout!
2284,126,Fights in Tight Spaces,80,KeenGamer,"Dec  6, 2021","Fights in Tight Spaces places itself in a unique position in the roguelike-deckbuilder genre. While the influence of games like Slay The Spire is apparent, the combat resolves in a very different way thanks to the introduction of a grid system and other turn-based tactics elements. The presentation is phenomenal and makes for an overall great game that is going to please fans of deckbuilders, tactic games and action movies buffs alike."
2285,126,Fights in Tight Spaces,80,NME,"Dec  3, 2021","Fights in Tight Spaces is one of my favourite strategy games of the year. The compelling blend of action movie sensibilities and big-brain strategic overtures means I’m struggling to put it down, and if you’re a fan of Slay The Spire or Monster Train, this is every bit as bruising a strategy game, and easily as replayable."
2286,126,Fights in Tight Spaces,78,Multiplayer.it,"Dec  9, 2021","Fights in Tight Spaces is a well-crafted card-based tactical turn-based roguelike that will satisfy fans of the genre.

2289,126,Fights in Tight Spaces,70,IGN,"Dec  3, 2021","Against popular thinking, the slower, methodical pace of Fights in Tight Spaces recreates that feeling of systematically dismantling a room full of goons that all the best action movies present so well, and that video games often struggle to properly simulate. The blend of tactical movement and positioning adds depth where the fairly limited deck synergy lacks it. And while the overarching progression can feel like an arduous grind at times, the compelling pugilistic dance in each isolated skirmish stays rewarding from the very first punch."

The future looks pretty bright for Lemnis Gate, and it has more than earned it."

While it might not come with a thrilling story, it does deliver a unique gameplay experience that will be enjoyable for FPS and strategy fans alike. Some of the game’s modes do start to feel repetitive after a while, but Lemnis Gate comes packed with four modes, different match formats, and several different characters to keep things interesting. If you’re a fan of the casual FPS format typical of games like Overwatch or Apex Legends but are keen for something new, Lemnis Gate will provide plenty of entertainment."
2300,127,Lemnis Gate,70,TheGamer,"Oct  4, 2021","I’m enthusiastic for the future of Lemnis Gate. You can play for hours and never see the same map twice, and you can play for an eternity and never have two identical matches. There is so much depth and strategic potential that it feels like you could spend a lifetime learning the game and inventing new strats and synergies. The turn based, asymmetric nature of the game makes it feel like a competitive shooter for people that don’t like shooters, and I’m always impressed when a game can cast a net so far outside of its core audience. Unlike a lot of team-based indie games, Lemnis Gate can theoretically survive with a much smaller player base thanks to only having 1v1 and 2v2 game modes. Despite its inaccessible premise, Lemnis Gate has a lot going for it and I’m excited to see how deep the wormhole goes."

You can populate this place with paintings, furniture and possessions, filling out its character and history, a decent metaphor for your progress through the story and the game. This is a lively world, with wonderful smaller mysteries and an overarching story that brings you closer to its famous main character and his personal history. While there are some technical issues, and the game understandably lacks the glossy polish of bigger-budget titles, this is nonetheless something that I’ve been wanting for a long time: a properly open-world interactive detective story."

Frogwares is taking the classic Sherlock mythos and spinning off some impressive original work here. The story is well-presented, with the partnership between Sherlock and Jon particularly pleasant. Other cases show some interesting new puzzle types that I have not yet seen before. Whilst the two strengths of this title are separate, which annoys me somewhat, it’s the annoyance I feel when a game is a few decisions short of me showering it in unqualified praise.

More engaging in its second part, Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One offers progressive dynamism and a commendable conclusion. The heart of the adventure lies in its clues to be connected and the accusations to be made, which follow a pattern of investigation which, however, runs out of steam too quickly."

The changes to gameplay balance mostly work, as does the implementation of the new Scramble game mode. However, the War mode shows that throwing more orcs into a stage doesn’t necessarily make it more fun, and the level design generally doesn’t feel quite as fresh as it once did. All that said, the visceral pleasure of slicing through a group of orcs with a buzzsaw launcher is as present as ever, and ultimately the experience is still a fun time.

With more content incoming and the card system offering new and fresh twists, Back 4 Blood is one I expect to be playing for a long time to come."
2344,131,Back 4 Blood,85,Digital Chumps,"Oct 21, 2021","Back 4 Blood is the ultimate cooperative experience, without a doubt. It may unwisely punish solo players and lack deeper launch content to attract and immerse casual players, potentially impacting the game’s community and longevity. But its core mode of pitting four players against an unyielding mob of monstrous death brings a constantly evolving, sometimes overwhelming challenge. If it weren’t for the extensively unique and clever card system and the overly satisfying gunplay, Back 4 Blood would stumble and shamble out of the gate. Yet its core mechanics provide such a fulfilling reward, that I can’t imagine not wanting to dive back in day after day and fend off the Ridden."
2345,131,Back 4 Blood,85,Stevivor,"Oct 13, 2021","Back 4 Blood doesn’t just imitate the Left 4 Dead formula like these titles, it elevates it past its predecessor. Perhaps it’s the nostalgia for the 12 year old title, or maybe just poor memory, that fuels our rose-tinted retrospection and distaste for something new. Regardless, Back 4 Blood takes the concept to the next level and builds in layers of cool ideas and just plain fun gameplay."
2346,131,Back 4 Blood,85,Worth Playing,"Oct 12, 2021","Back 4 Blood is a fun blend of the classic Left 4 Dead template with a reasonable inclusion of modern traits. The basic zombie shooting brings forth just as many memorable and chaotic moments as the developer's original series, and the game absolutely sings in multiplayer, but the solo experience remains engaging for those who only get along with bots. The modern touches add some depth that doesn't detract from what makes this kind of game so fun in the first place. The steps to increase replayability accomplish that without feeling forced. Despite a few minor issues here and there, Back 4 Blood is a solid debut, and those who wanted some progress in the genre are going to find it in buckets here."

I’d like to see the difficulty spikes addressed and some expanded PvP choices, both of which I think can and will be pretty easily added and fixed. I’m also hoping that more people start playing it, as most of the runs I’ve joined have at least one BOT in it and is often nothing but BOTs (and when I’m playing with nothing but BOTs, why do I have to wait for online server space to play it?). The BOTs are competent shooters, and use their player advantages pretty well, but have zero ability with regards to the additional level objectives – they won’t plant explosives or carry supplies, and they tend to hang near you, which is good from a survival perspective, but doesn’t help in finding weapon and healing caches. But for a team that plays well together, and I’m hoping to get my crew to move over from L4D, it’s a fine zombie run and gun."

It maintains the fundamentals of what made the original so addictive and satisfying while adding its own little flair with the rogue-like deck building system.

It definitely needs some tweaks here and there, but it’s a blast with or without friends, and the bots are pretty decent as well. Turtle Rock Studios could have just made a straight clone of L4D, but it didn’t.

By playing on the lowest difficulty, in fact, the offer is substantially in line with the Left 4 Dead canons, appropriately updated and enriched with a greater variety of play. However, when you find yourself taking up arms in the most ""hardcore"" modes (a physiological stage in a title like this), you cannot help but appreciate the innovations introduced in terms of progression and the merits of the Card System developed by Turtle Rock Studio, which greatly increase the tactical depth of the gameplay and the cooperative dynamics underlying the experience. Back 4 Blood is certainly not a perfect title, but overall the Californian team's proposal is effective and well thought out. It goes without saying that to fully enjoy it you will necessarily have to find suitable companions, but we can assure you that the game is worth the candle."

The excellent map and mission design, the huge variety of builds made possible by the card system, and satisfying gameplay make the game by Turtle Rock Studios the one to get for those who have a team of friends ready to take on hordes of undead, but those who are looking to play the game solo would do better to look elsewhere, as Back 4 Blood doesn't offer much for those not too keen on teamwork."

This title promise complex experiences, that defy the laws of physics and communication, where hope is always the last to die. In a scenario where resources are low, and the hordes are endless, the path is long until the next safe zone. In contrast, it shows some bugs that although aren't game breaking, turn the attention from which should be a gameplay focused exclusively on the mission, without any visual distraction.

It misses the mark with Swarm and needs an offline mode, but its core shooter mechanics and card-driven gameplay combine for an excellent evolution of the co-op formula. The depth of post-launch support it receives will rely on the success of Back 4 Blood's multiplayer offerings and that can't be presently assured, but this latest attempt easily escapes the shadow of Evolve's flop and builds on what made Left 4 Dead a classic."

2387,132,Dodgeball Academia,84,RPG Fan,"Aug 23, 2021","At the end of the day, though, Dodgeball Academia hits all the right notes to become a smash hit multimedia entity. Not only can I see an animation and comic book or manga series, but I can also picture a plethora of Dodgeball Academia merchandise like stickers, apparel, toys, phone accessories, dodgeballs, and much more. So you should enroll in Dodgeball Academia today and become the sports anime protagonist you’ve always wanted to be."
2388,132,Dodgeball Academia,80,The Indie Game Website,"Aug 17, 2021","For the most part, though, Dodgeball Academia is an unbridled joy with a lovely cast of wholesome characters, even though the narrative isn’t always that fresh. If it was merely fun and silly writing alone, I’d still thoroughly enjoy my time with it because it reminds me fondly of excitedly waking up on a Saturday to watch daft cartoons and play video games—back to simpler times. The fact that the act of playing dodgeball is also fantastic is a warmly welcomed bonus."
2389,132,Dodgeball Academia,80,NME,"Aug  5, 2021","Dodgeball Academia is some of the purest fun you can have. The quirky visual style meshes perfectly with the absurd action and will always result in a huge smile on your face.

It might end up only getting second place when it comes to this year’s dodgeball games, but it’s a close race, and it still deserves a trophy regardless."

Many clever mechanics make the marriage between the two a natural fit in this game. Some unsatisfying character progression, late-game repetitive battles, and a needlessly prolonged final stretch do set it back, but I think it is still a solid attempt at such a novel concept."
2393,132,Dodgeball Academia,70,Screen Rant,"Aug  6, 2021","Min-maxers can prioritize equipment and stat upgrades to further sabotage any challenge, but everyone else can just jump into Dodgeball Academia’s matches and glide through the snappy story. By the end, a full roster of characters unlock for use in a versus mode pack-in, albeit with no online multiplayer available. Super Dodge Ball fans will immediately respond to what Pocket Trap is up to here, but Dodgeball Academia should also prove an easygoing delight to anyone looking to sink into a very specific type of sports RPG."

2396,133,Before Your Eyes,100,GameSkinny,"Apr 15, 2021","Telling a gut punch of a story with novel gameplay mechanics is no small feat, and Before Your Eyes marvelously delivers on both fronts. Just as Edith Finch and Firewatch before it told stories only games can tell and used mechanics we would likely never see borrowed elsewhere, Before Your Eyes feels like it's immediately timeless and permanently unique."
2397,133,Before Your Eyes,98,Impulsegamer,"Apr 28, 2021","The blink mechanic is fantastic and really immerses you in the story, you can work around it if you really want to… but I think the way the game is set out, most players will be willing to let their eyelids dictate the story and let it go where it may. For the price, this is unquestionably a must buy! Humanity in a unique interactive story!"

Before Your Eyes manages to be interesting and quirky, whilst also finding new ways to immerse you in a beautiful story. It is deeply sad at times, and at others fills you with an immense joy and appreciation for people and their complex lives. There is so much about this game that is better experienced for the first time with no forewarning, but if you like heartfelt stories and powerful narratives, this one's for you."
2400,133,Before Your Eyes,90,GameCritics,"Apr 21, 2021","Despite my occasionally-bloodshot orbs, Before Your Eyes is an experience I won’t soon forget. Its combination of masterful storytelling, engaging character progression and stunning conclusion put it in contention for best narrative game I’ve ever played, and it also reminded me to savor life at its best and worst moments. No small feat for an indie title hanging everything on an all-new form of interaction."
2401,133,Before Your Eyes,90,God is a Geek,"Apr  6, 2021","Before Your Eyes is an emotional tale with an interesting mechanic at its core that helps to make the game so immersive. The music and voice acting is superb, and it is something you should certainly experience."
2402,133,Before Your Eyes,90,GameSpew,"Apr  6, 2021","Before Your Eyes is a short journey, but it is one that you’ll likely find yourself playing again and again. You’ve never heard a story like this before and you’ve certainly never experienced it in this way. Not only is it truly innovative, it’s also heartfelt, filled with love, and will likely leave you mopping up your tears before the credits roll."
2403,133,Before Your Eyes,85,CD-Action,"Dec  7, 2021","The game was designed to be controlled with eye movements and blinking, but as this system doesn’t work perfectly (sometimes I had to open my eyes very wide and blink very dramatically for the game to notice), I appreciated the fact that the mouse works too. The immersion might have suffered, but it was a price I was willing to pay to be able to enjoy the story without any issues and frustration. And the story is what makes Before Your Eyes great – it only lasts two hours, but still managed to surprise me and pluck just the right emotional string."

With intelligent writing and a thought-provoking handling of themes around death and regret, Before Your Eyes comes through as a concise and rich first-person experience, evoking something in anyone who plays it. Once you accept that its unique selling point is far more optional than originally intended, appreciating the love that undoubtedly went into this story becomes far easier. Put the webcam away, and you'll definitely cherish this short yet unforgettable tale, enough to even revisit in the years to come."
2406,133,Before Your Eyes,85,Noisy Pixel,"Apr  6, 2021","What works so well for Before Your Eyes is the sheer amount of quality and effort put into its creation.

It’s a wonderfully crafted indie game that demands to be up there in your must-play list for 2021.
2408,133,Before Your Eyes,80,GameSpot,"Apr 21, 2021","Before Your Eyes understands that experiencing our lives, of storing memories which become precious, is often tied to what we see: the people and the paths stretching out before us. Instead of feeling like a gimmick, Before Your Eyes feels refreshingly natural. Unusual control schemes often make me long for the familiarity of a controller. Sure, I can speak to my Nintendogs using the microphone on the DS, but sometimes I don’t want to yell at my shih tzu on a Delta flight. Before Your Eyes manages to do the opposite. Its unique mechanic matches its narrative so perfectly, that you won’t want to play it any other way."
2409,133,Before Your Eyes,80,Screen Rant,"Apr  6, 2021","Before Your Eyes is a difficult game to discuss, as so much of its appeal comes from reveals that would spoil the story. The game offers a truly unique experience that utilizes the medium of the video game perfectly to enhance its story. The technical flaws are frustrating, but they're likely impossible to avoid in a game like this, and people who can overlook the control issues will find a phenomenal story about life and death as seen through the eyes of another."
2410,133,Before Your Eyes,80,Finger Guns,"Apr  6, 2021","A few annoying glitches can’t spoil the ground-breaking, emotional journey of Before Your Eyes.

It’s only a few hours long but that’s more than enough time for this game to get under your skin and leave its mark."
2411,133,Before Your Eyes,78,Meristation,"Apr 27, 2021","Blinking is Before Your Eyes’ main tool to transmit unique messages and feelings, but at the same time is used in many narrative situations that do not need them."
2412,133,Before Your Eyes,75,GamingTrend,"Apr  6, 2021","Mechanically, it falls short of its true potential, but you can’t help but get swept up in the journeys of these characters. The game’s got heart, and none of its flaws can really take that away."

2421,134,Genesis Noir,90,But Why Tho?,"Apr  6, 2021","The best way to summarize Genesis Noir is that it is an art piece that is only possible in its medium. It is a beautiful experience full of emotional connections, and that is told genuinely and with such intelligence that it is deeply relatable. It is a profound experience and one wholly unique to the industry."
2422,134,Genesis Noir,90,GameSpew,"Mar 25, 2021","Genesis Noir may not be for everyone. You’ll need patience for it – and if you like games that hold your hand, it’s likely not for you. But stick with it, and you’ll find an extraordinary and rare title unlike anything else you’ve played. It’s beautiful, clever, and very tricky in places – but you’ll be thinking about it long after you’ve turned it off."
2423,134,Genesis Noir,85,Multiplayer.it,"Mar 29, 2021","Anyone who has felt attracted to this game will hardly be disappointed, those who continue to think that these narrative adventures are not real games, can safely go further because Genesis Noir is not here to make you change your mind."

2425,134,Genesis Noir,85,PC Invasion,"Mar 25, 2021","Stirring, artistic, and emotionally resonant, Genesis Noir is quite a unique experience. The puzzles can be tedious, but the game makes up for it with gorgeous art direction and sterling creativity."
2426,134,Genesis Noir,85,Destructoid,"Mar 25, 2021","By zipping through the creation of life itself, you might just find answers to why someone has been shot and how to stop it. Though some puzzles and controls can get pretty frustrating, the adventure itself is the draw, and with Genesis Noir, it's a beautiful trip through primordial creation worth taking. If you're eager to see what kind of stylish, inventive ways developers are finding to tell stories in games, this hard-boiled trip is worth the ticket."
2427,134,Genesis Noir,81,IGN Italia,"Mar 31, 2021","Genesis Noir is a sublime trip through the history of the universe. Feral Cat Den did a terrific job in terms of balancing scientific premises and mythic consequences developing a linear, but visionary, point and click experience, whose only little sin is to indulge sometimes in its own beauty."
2428,134,Genesis Noir,80,CD-Action,"Nov 19, 2021","Even though you can briefly describe Genesis Noir as an adventure game with occasional puzzles, in fact it’s a completely unique, extraordinary experience unlike anything I’ve played. [06/2021, p.58]"
2429,134,Genesis Noir,80,Hey Poor Player,"Apr  6, 2021","Although I feel like I didn’t quite understand all of what Genesis Noir was trying to accomplish in story, I absolutely understood the emotional journey it took me on. From the joyous beginnings to the urgently depressing ending and even the loneliness, hope, and determination that came after, Genesis Noir is a celebration of humanity, the universe, and of life itself."
2430,134,Genesis Noir,80,The Indie Game Website,"Mar 29, 2021","As with many art-focused games, it’s painful to discuss a work’s aspirations and pretensions without degrading the ambition of its ideas, especially in an industry where art-games are often relegated to the sidelines of mainstream discourse. Genesis Noir is at once a remarkable creative achievement that embodies the best and brightest of the art-game genre. But as the game unfolds in all its zany glory, it also loses its way at the end–the message gets through, but the repetition becomes tedious. Perhaps the best way to reinvent the Big Bang isn’t in one harried review sitting. Play it slow and savor it."

2433,134,Genesis Noir,70,Adventure Gamers,"May 10, 2021","Genesis Noir’s gorgeous graphics may be mostly in black and white, but its cosmic journey through Earth’s past is anything but, though at times it’s a little too convoluted to be as ingenious as it could have been."
2434,134,Genesis Noir,70,Shacknews,"Apr  2, 2021","Genesis Noir is a very curious game, and mostly in a good way. The cosmic nature of its narrative is tied down interestingly in its humanized elements and the animation and music do a good job of giving every moment life and charm, even if it can sometimes get confusing. It’s not a long game, and some of its stretches are a bit too simplistic for their own good, but Genesis Noir also features a lot of creativity in prominent portions of its puzzles and progression. If you enjoy a good point-and-click adventure and don’t mind a game that just wants a moment to share its bombastic narrative of cosmic creation and love, Genesis Noir might very well be narrative worth your time and interest."
2435,134,Genesis Noir,70,Eurogamer Italy,"Mar 25, 2021","Genesis Noir will drag you in a very (VERY) strange love adventure, with hypnotic aesthetic and cozy smooth jazz soundtrack."
2436,134,Genesis Noir,70,God is a Geek,"Mar 25, 2021","Genesis Noir is a simple puzzler with point-and-click elements that are stripped back to reveal an engaging and beautiful story. It may be too easy and rather linear, but it's still a well presented game that'll keep you engaged throughout."
2437,134,Genesis Noir,68,Meristation,"Apr 11, 2021","Story driven narrative experience with gorgeous and astonishing visuals about a metaphoric cosmic love story that causes the big bang. Sadly, it's clunky and sometimes obtuse gameplay doesn't match it superb presentation. A fresh and original game not suitable for everyone."
2438,134,Genesis Noir,60,Screen Rant,"Apr  1, 2021","Slices of Genesis Noir are much better than others, and certain interactive interludes are inarguably sublime. Still, fussing with a mouse cursor until something happens is hardly compelling as gameplay, nor is holding down a key to walk slowly and endlessly in one direction until interrupted with a short cinematic. It's the type of game where even a slight irritation risks breaking its spell, making them louder than its superb soundtrack. As a result, it's unlikely that Genesis Noir will seat comfortably with any and all gamers who catch its orbit, and it begs a surprising amount of patience for its overall brevity, but it’s also definitely one of a kind."
2439,134,Genesis Noir,55,GameCritics,"Apr 22, 2021","Genesis Noir stands out as an unique experience in the current landscape. There’s no argument there. However, for all of its gorgeous art, daring concepts and oblique storytelling, the gameplay and interaction required to succeed in this medium ends up failing to connect and doesn’t engage with the player in ways that feel significant."
2440,135,Olija,90,GameGrin,"Mar  1, 2021","Olija is a fun and engrossing action-adventure game that has you fighting foes and solving puzzles with a magical harpoon. A little on the short side, but a fun experience that leaves you wanting more."
2441,135,Olija,90,Shacknews,"Feb  2, 2021","Olija is incredibly cinematic, despite its minimalist approach to art style. The game still feels fantastical thanks to an incredible attention to detail with both the visual and sound design. In addition, Olija tells a heartfelt story with important themes, while keeping satisfying gameplay at the center of it all. It becomes even more impressive when you realize the game was practically developed by one person, Thomas Olsson of Skeleton Crew Studios. Olija is a pleasant treat and likely an early frontrunner for one of the best indie titles of 2021."
2442,135,Olija,90,PC Invasion,"Jan 28, 2021","Olija is a unique, intriguing adventure that brings players to a strange land. It isn't long but its length is enough. The visuals and atmosphere are first-rate, as are the combat and level design. All of that makes it an easy game to recommend."
2443,135,Olija,85,ZTGD,"Jan 29, 2021","Overall Olija is a good game. I just wish it was longer. I finished a fair portion of the game in around 5 hours and I can’t imagine I would have spent much longer had I decided to get all the collectibles. However, I think $15 is the perfect price for Olija; I much rather have a short good game than a long mediocre one and being left wanting more is a much better problem to have than never wanting to touch a game again. Just know that Olija is a concise but strong experience and a great way to start off 2021."
2444,135,Olija,85,Noisy Pixel,"Jan 28, 2021","Olija is a game that thrives in its Asian fantasy atmosphere and well-realized gameplay. The story and soundtrack are artistic and evoke special moods, while the combat and exploration are a neat and interesting package. The journey is short and sweet and only held back by a few stumbles in its narrative delivery."
2445,135,Olija,83,Meristation,"Mar 28, 2021","Wonderfully inventive and with a charm that's all its own,  Olija delights and surprises at every turn. The very personal creation of Thomas Ollson this is a game that every videogame lover should save an afternoon to fully experience. Lovely."
2446,135,Olija,83,PC Gamer,"Jan 28, 2021","I was bowled over by the level of quality of all this one person has achieved. Olija is clearly Olsson's personal work, and its story, of Europeans lost in mysterious and frightening Eastern waters, in part reflects his own experience of moving from his birthplace in France to Japan to be with his wife. But I felt sometimes a disquieting air of orientalist fantasy, as we encounter an inscrutable culture headed by the beautiful Lady Olija, who we chase into submission. But I also loved the clash of rough and ready mariners facing a strange and terrible world of corrupted beauty. I only wish their voyage was a little longer."
2447,135,Olija,82,COGconnected,"Jan 28, 2021","Because despite the strength of Olija's tone and mechanics, it is a very moody game. There's not a lot to say in indie platformers that hasn't been done elsewhere and so it all comes down to execution. I don't think the story or characters or themes of Olija will stick with me for a long time, but I will remember the game nonetheless. I will remember the world actually, as if I was the one braving mosquito filled bogs and slimy tombs. Thomas Olsson and Skeleton Crew Studio aren't telling stories so much as they are crafting worlds. That's what kind of game Olija is: a world you can get lost in."

If you loved classic exploration and combat titles on the PC from the ’80s, then this experience has plenty to offer. The graphical style will be charming, the gameplay challenging enough but not impossible to master. The narrative is not too engaging but it will keep players interested. Unfortunately, there’s little to bring in those who simply lack those gaming memories. The pixelated look can easily be judged as hard to understand, stifling experimentation and making it hard to enjoy the exploration. The harpoon mechanics are solid but they cannot sustain the game on their own. More care to make it accessible for a wider range of players would have made the entire experience more attractive."
2450,135,Olija,80,Guardian,"Feb  4, 2021","This game made me feel like a swashbuckling stranger in a foreign land for a couple of evenings, and left me wanting more. What’s there is lean and sometimes exquisite, but there wasn’t time to fully explore the different weapons (or try on all those dapper hats) before Faraday’s adventure came to an end after around six hours. I could have spent twice as long exploring this beautiful and mysterious creation, but I’m grateful nonetheless for the journey I’ve had."

Only, by the time we have fully assimilated its mechanics, Olija has stopped. As soon as the last gear is unlocked, the end credits take us back from the gaming systems that were only waiting for a final level to shine brightly. We would have liked to be able to test our abilities in one final twisted climb, defending ourselves from an ambush with uncertain outcome or in a final duel at the top like Genishiro Ashina de Sekiro."
2453,135,Olija,80,AusGamers,"Jan 29, 2021","It’s not all seamless, exactly how it’s blend of home-base to expedition works takes a while to become apparent – leading to some confusion. The combat too and dashing about is a little imprecise (even when using a d-pad) which can lead to some frustrating boss encounters. In the end, through brevity, variety, and focus, Olija is a rewarding slice of action, contemplative fiction, with great action-adventure design."
2454,135,Olija,80,GameMAG,"Jan 29, 2021","We hope that Skeleton Crew Studio will not stop at one game, and we'll learn the further story of relationships between Faraday and Olija in the sequel."
2455,135,Olija,80,GameSpot,"Jan 28, 2021","Olija's best asset, truly, is its brevity. Its story is impeccably paced. Its mechanics never wear out from overuse. From start to finish, it finds new ways to gently goad you into using the harpoon in different ways, until it says its piece. I was taken with how emotionally resonant and mechanically pleasing it could be in such a short time. Succinct and satisfying is a rare combination, and it makes Olija a rare treat."

However, its focus on fluid action, combat and atmosphere are redeeming qualities that give the game a straightforward direction that many modern games are missing."
2460,135,Olija,70,Screen Rant,"Jan 28, 2021","Olija enters a crowded genre and its gameplay does little to revolutionize the scene, but it still manages to stand out with a unique visual style that greatly contributes to its intriguing, atmospheric tone. Anyone interested in the story should go in blind, as a sense of mystery adds to the experience. The Devolver catalog has often curated the best in niche indie games, and Olija is another good addition for those looking for a unique, moody, maritime experience."
2461,135,Olija,70,IGN,"Jan 28, 2021","Olija is a short-lived odyssey, and it would’ve been great if there were additional difficulties or any sort of incentive to replay its brief, four-hour campaign. But as a bite-sized 2D action adventure, it leaves a very strong impression thanks to a magical harpoon that makes fighting, moving, and discovering secrets especially rewarding. Its combat in particular packs a surprising amount of depth and flexibility, even if its enemies and bosses never really stepped up and demanded that I engage with that depth to defeat them. Much like Faraday himself, I don’t see myself ever returning to Olija’s mysterious world, but it’s an adventure I won’t soon forget."

But it’s not a game that really lit me on fire in any way. I almost feel like part of me would have preferred a more flawed title in some ways, something that felt like it was reaching a little more in an area other than just raw presentation…But some of this might just be me being cantankerous. I can’t say Olija is all that great, but it’s definitely a solid game that aimed at what it wanted to be and hit it squarely. It’s unlikely to be anyone’s favorite game, but it is – at least – doing its own thing with no small degree of confidence."

Devolver has a knack for publishing quirky and unique fare, and that tradition continues here. I just wish it wasn’t so short. Because the world of Terraphage is a fascinating one, and I really wish I could have gotten more lost in it. But those complaints aside, this is still a very solid game worth checking out. Here’s hoping the next project by Skeleton Crew Studio is a bit more robust."
2465,135,Olija,60,TheGamer,"Jan 28, 2021","I can't say that Olija is a complete misfire. The way that the characters and enemies are animated in this pixel art style is superb. The world of Terraphage is fantastically bleak and it says a lot that my biggest criticism that I wanted to spend more time there. Unfortunately, the combat mechanics and story lack the depth that I wanted them to have. There are some good ideas here, but Olija is a voyage that ends far too soon."
2466,135,Olija,60,Hardcore Gamer,"Jan 28, 2021","Olija doesn’t do enough to be regarded as generally good, but at the same time doesn’t frustrate to the point of truly damaging the experience. Had Olija been without its frantic, harpoon-wielding combat, the story might’ve been different. Then again, the similar emphasis on a story and a world that feels neither purposeful nor refined, could’ve had the result land in more promising waters too. Perhaps this middling indecisiveness is the real conclusion to draw from a game like Olija. A short, platforming-of-sorts release that doesn’t commit to any one definable trait and ends up a scatterbrain of ideas that don’t gel or add up to anything remarkable. At the same time, providing little to evoke any manner of meaningful investment. That’s not to say there isn’t enjoyment and moments of delight to find here, but there’s something equally dispensable about Olija‘s design and equally “seen before” with its tone, that doesn’t hit home as effectively as it may want to."

The gameplay also works most of the time, but as is often the case with indie games, the authoritarian developer has gone overboard. The less is usually more but here, the style simply went over the substance and 12 hours of playtime more than overstays its welcome considering the game's ultimately shallow bounty."

2526,138,The Big Con,85,God is a Geek,"Aug 31, 2021","The Big Con is a welcome nod to one of the coolest decades of all time, featuring some great writing, beautiful visuals, and fun gameplay."
2527,138,The Big Con,85,WellPlayed,"Aug 31, 2021","The Big Con is a bright, fun and surprisingly wholesome crime spree through a Saturday morning cartoon version of 90s America. You might develop a compulsion for kleptomania, you might feel bad for picking hundreds of pockets, but at least you'll laugh along the way and feel cool doing it."
2528,138,The Big Con,83,Vandal,"Aug 31, 2021","This is a great narrative adventure inspired by the 90s, with funny, well-written dialogues and a very unique art style."
2529,138,The Big Con,80,Hey Poor Player,"Nov 11, 2021","The Big Con is a heart-warming coming of age story that will delight 90s kids, referential-humor enjoyers, and those with sticky fingers. Its relatable protagonist never loses her heart of gold, despite the horrible circumstances she finds herself in, which serves as a shining testament to the dev team’s ability to carefully craft a story using controversial mechanics. If you have $14.99 and 7 – 10 hours to spare, take a look at The Big Con — it’s bound to steal your heart."
2530,138,The Big Con,80,NME,"Aug 31, 2021","Despite some technical glitches, The Big Con succeeds in telling a moving story with plenty of wit and charm. The aesthetics and humour are spot-on, each character brings a new dimension, and this is a world worth getting lost in. If you’re looking for a healthy dose of ‘90s nostalgia and a throwaway attitude to petty crime – give it a go. I swear I’m not having you on. This time."
2531,138,The Big Con,80,Gfinity,"Aug 31, 2021","You’ll only need several hours to complete it, but The Big Con’s one adventure worth looking into. Offering a vibrant presentation brimming with nostalgia, there’s an enjoyable story about 90’s America which kept me hooked. Though the pickpocketing mechanic lacks depth, that’s made up for by a fun narrative and good sense of humour, keeping the action entertaining. If you like indies, The Big Con’s a breath of fresh air that comes recommended."

2533,138,The Big Con,70,GameSpot,"Aug 31, 2021","The Big Con is ultimately about its story, though, and it's a story that mostly works despite an inescapable sense of familiarity. There aren't many beats here that you haven't seen before, and while that lends the closing hours the feeling that expected pieces are simply falling into place, the game has enough verve and style that it manages to hold it together. The writing isn't especially funny or clever, but there's enough personality in the art style and story conceit that I was still entertained for the bulk of the six hours that I spent with it."
2534,138,The Big Con,70,Hardcore Gamer,"Aug 31, 2021","The Big Con succeeds when, as its title suggests, you’re working on elaborate con jobs that provide clever puzzle ideas with a lot of open and fun gameplay. While the rest of it is fine, it never feels like the sort of epic cross-country adventure it should be, despite what its stakes would suggest. It still makes for a good adventure with well-done challenges, and that alone may be worth it, but don’t expect a grand score by the end."
2535,138,The Big Con,70,Screen Rant,"Aug 31, 2021","The Big Con is a charming little slice of nineties nostalgia. It's propelled by its strong writing and world-building, a deep understanding of the era it is referencing, and some fantastic characters, and it's certainly a road trip players will enjoy taking. Although its gameplay is limited and there are some technical issues, it's an earnest and compelling journey."
2536,138,The Big Con,70,Shacknews,"Aug 31, 2021","Even if it does get monotonous sometimes, I certainly can't fault the originality of the pickpocketing idea. The Big Con is not the kind of adventure game I see every day and credit to Mighty Yell for trying something different. I don't know if it's because I was hoping more would be done with the idea or because the game felt too short, but I ultimately came out of this game wanting something more. Maybe that's just the hunger for a bigger score."
2537,138,The Big Con,65,Multiplayer.it,"Aug 31, 2021","The Big Con is a nice game, but not very deep. It entertains for the time it lasts, but in the end it doesn't give much in terms of experience, if not for its graphic style that stands out on everything else."
2538,139,Final Fantasy II Pixel Remaster,90,Gamer Escape,"Aug  5, 2021","The biggest impediment to recommending these games to others is just the fact that, well… in many ways they are slight things. None of these games are terribly long if you know what you’re doing, nor are they tremendously difficult. The stories are not super compelling on their own. They are little games in a way, and they are definitely aged. But if you loved these games before, these remasters are perfect for what they’re trying to do. They’re charming. They feel like a sudden rush of nostalgia not because they’re exactly the games you remember, but the rare form of remaster that does add some stuff on top while still preserving all of the spirit and intent perfectly. And if you’ve never played these games but want to understand why people loved them so much, these are the perfect way to try them out."
2539,139,Final Fantasy II Pixel Remaster,85,CGMagazine,"Jul 29, 2021","The first three Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters deftly walk the line between old and new, but might not convert anyone without the stomach for old JRPGs."

The soundtracks are lovingly orchestrated and the pixel art is gorgeous, though the latter does lose some detail in the translation. Each game feels great to play, but I do wish extra content from previous releases or remakes had been included."
2541,139,Final Fantasy II Pixel Remaster,80,Gfinity,"Aug  5, 2021","So what we're left with is a slightly uneven collection. The core material is still brilliant, made exponentially more so with the stellar soundtracks and built-in music player, but you'll be a bit disappointed if you were hoping for anything other than the core material."
2542,139,Final Fantasy II Pixel Remaster,75,Worth Playing,"Aug  4, 2021","Final Fantasy II is probably the first weird experimental game in the franchise. This can be both good, such as the more involved plots and characters, but it can also be bad, such as the weird halfway-there leveling system that comes close to being something special but misses the mark. Final Fantasy II: Pixel Remaster is a basic rerelease of the game that's difficult to recommend unless you don't have any other version available. It looks nice and sounds great, but the loss of optional content really stands out."
2543,139,Final Fantasy II Pixel Remaster,73,Wccftech,"Aug  9, 2021","The first three Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters are a somewhat solid remastering effort that could have been so much better with a few tweaks. While the amazing rearranged soundtracks sound great and the balancing tweaks make the three games still feel great to play, the divisive overhauled visuals reminiscent of the 16-bit entries, technical issues like the lack of a V-Sync toggle and display settings not saving and lack of additional content found in prior remakes make these remasters a truly worthy purchase only for those who live and breathe Final Fantasy."
2544,139,Final Fantasy II Pixel Remaster,72,RPG Fan,"Jul 29, 2021","As it stands, if you’re a FF series completionist like myself, this is easily the version of FFII I’d recommend given what it offers and the fact that it doesn’t potentially overstay its welcome since it doesn’t have the extra dungeons found in other ports, but I can’t say I’ll be replaying Final Fantasy II either."
2545,139,Final Fantasy II Pixel Remaster,70,Siliconera,"Jul 30, 2021","There’s a lot to like about Final Fantasy II Pixel Remaster. It was an entry that dared to be different. Even now, when you look at the series as a whole, it stands out. And with this version, it looks good, runs rather well, and is pretty widely accessible. The as-is font situation isn’t great, but the rest of the game is quite pretty and fun to play."
2546,139,Final Fantasy II Pixel Remaster,70,RPG Site,"Jul 29, 2021","I come away from Final Fantasy 1, 2, and 3 looking forward to the remaining games more than I did before. I appreciate the new features like the enhanced bestiary, the auto-combat feature, making grinding friendlier, and I LOVE the new soundtracks. But I hope they manage to address issues like the screen tearing and especially the font before the last three games release."
2547,139,Final Fantasy II Pixel Remaster,70,Hardcore Gamer,"Jul 29, 2021","Final Fantasy II Pixel Remaster is a great way to experience one of the less talked about Final Fantasy games, even if it is one of the weaker titles in the franchise. Final Fantasy II seems to suffer from a bit of middle child syndrome. In some ways it does improve on its predecessor, but while it’s clearly the more advanced game, part of the original’s charm was in its simplicity. Final Fantasy II’s advancements seem to hint at how great the series will become instead of simply being great itself. Playing Final Fantasy II Pixel Remaster for the review was a great time and it’s recommended as a must-play for any Final Fantasy fan, but part of that is based on getting a historical perspective on how Final Fantasy has evolved. The innovative approaches to the game mechanics have resulted in a experience that’s oftentimes a tedious grind despite everything else positive that can be said."

2549,140,Sable,90,Gaming Nexus,"Oct  5, 2021","Sable plays like a young person's diary, full of hope and apologies, staying grounded while reaching for stars. It trades in its combat for climbing puzzles instead, and isn't afraid to let you bunny hop across a mustard-yellow desert or stand perfectly still—with the encouraging words of people recounting their own wonder years."
2550,140,Sable,90,GameSpot,"Sep 23, 2021","Sable is a little rough around the edges, then, yet these shortcomings are far outweighed by its numerous strengths. This is a relaxing adventure that's both familiar and quite unlike anything else. It gives you the freedom to approach things at your own pace--in your own way--while managing to dispel any notions of aimlessness. Even if you don't have a particular objective in mind, you're guaranteed to discover new sights and sounds by hopping on your hoverbike and simply exploring. It's the antithesis to most open-world design, where the onus is on getting you to the next point of interest as soon as possible, and so it stands out even if you remove its beautiful art style from the equation. Sable is methodical, introspective, comforting, and fully deserving of your time."
2551,140,Sable,90,PC Invasion,"Sep 22, 2021","Striking, peaceful, and wholly focused on exploring at your own pace, Sable is a joy to play. The optimization could use some serious work, but this is an extremely compelling game that offers a better open-world experience than many AAA developers have crafted."
2552,140,Sable,90,GamingTrend,"Sep 22, 2021","Sable is high on the list of game of the year contenders in one jam packed with them. It’s a gorgeous, immersive coming of age story that happens organically and at your own pace - you can see as much or as little of the game as you like. While it certainly has its share of issues, Midden is just a place you have to visit."
2553,140,Sable,90,But Why Tho?,"Sep 22, 2021","Playing Sable very well may be as close as one can get to a meditative experience while playing a game. Few games feel as good to simply exist within as Sable. The game’s gorgeous visuals, warm and comforting music, and intuitive game design all come together to create a unique experience about trying to find one’s place in the world through an expression of an individual’s freedom."
2554,140,Sable,90,Wccftech,"Sep 22, 2021","For those yearning to explore, Sable offers the chance to do it at your own speed, with your own goals, and without the need to exert violence or experience shocking twists. Sable is confident the world is interesting enough and is completely right in that regard."
2555,140,Sable,90,Checkpoint Gaming,"Sep 22, 2021","The occasional bug and missing stamina upgrades are really the only negatives I can lodge at Sable. I can think of very few games that have presented such a beautiful harmony of its attributes. Everything supports everything else. The story implores you to go out into the world, to see all that there is to see. The gameplay ensures that the focus is always on the vistas that lay before you, and it's all stylised beautifully. The game creates a view of which I cannot tire. This is truly one of the most well-conceived and executed games that I have seen in a very long time. It's one of those games that truly is using everything to its maximum potential."

Beyond its artistic merits, the game is supremely fun to play. It's a title that adventure gamers and art lovers alike will happily explore for hours on end, and despite the occasional bug, it's a very well-made game. Sable is well worth adding to any adventure gamer's library, and I eagerly await Shedworks' next big title."
2558,140,Sable,88,Game Informer,"Sep 22, 2021","Sable ends in the same way it starts, at home with family. The narrative payoff is not actually about your final choice, and that may rub more goal-oriented players the wrong way. However, I found the conclusion a fitting end to a side quest-filled exploration game. For those who love to explore, I can’t recommend Sable enough. Every element – beautiful graphics, compelling traversal, and player-driven plot – works together to ensure I simply lose myself in the world."
2559,140,Sable,80,Gamer.nl,"Nov 16, 2021","Anyone willing to bury their head in the sand for the many technical problems will find Sable a stunning and relaxed open world game.

2560,140,Sable,80,Guardian,"Nov  6, 2021","This is a barren world, but rendered exquisitely, drawing careful inspiration from French cartoonist Jean “Moebius” Giraud in its blend of space and intricacy. Exploring its crannies delivers a slow-burn joy. Developed by a small team from north London (Shedworks, because the two founders began work in a garden shed), Sable is an unusual expression of the so-called “open world” – the dominant video game genre today. Most lead you in certain directions, ensuring you approach landmarks from the best angles, matching every plot beat with a suitable musical flourish. Here, by contrast, you are totally free to explore wherever, whenever, however you wish. There are whispered points of interest, but there is no wearying to-do list, and as such your journey and destination are uniquely, wonderfully personal."

2564,140,Sable,80,The Indie Game Website,"Sep 27, 2021","Making an interactive facsimile of Moebius’ style is a daunting task. While it isn’t always a slam dunk, Sable provides handsome eye candy, encouraging you to climb mountains for the view alone. The anticipated score from Japanese Breakfast is even more versatile, stringing the wasteland with theremin, accordions, shoegaze and desert psych. It’s a shame that the initial glider sounds like loose change in a dryer, so I encourage players strictly seeking to vibe to trade up for better parts as soon as they can."

Some gamers will appreciate it for the chill, Zen-like, conflict-and-combat-free, emotionally resonant story that it absolutely is. Other gamers may grow impatient with its lack of real incident, and weary of the pace and absence of challenge. I tend to land in the latter camp. Sable is a beautiful game, but it needs to rev up the dramatic engine or raise the stakes for the player to keep fidgety gamers like me engaged."

2601,141,Persona 5 Strikers,80,DarkZero,"Feb 26, 2021","Persona 5 Strikers might not be the full fat Persona experience nor a true Warriors game – it is certainly targeting the Persona fans more than Warriors fans – but it is a quality extension to the Persona 5 story, a worthy summer road trip that might be advertised as a spin-off, but truly feels more like a sequel with a new flavour sprinkled on top."
2602,141,Persona 5 Strikers,80,Easy Allies,"Feb 24, 2021","If you have an attachment to the world and characters of Persona 5, you owe it to yourself to play Strikers. The shift in genre makes combat exciting, and the story manages to capture so much of what made Persona 5 such an outstanding game. The Phantom Thieves are back, not in some watered down spin off, but in a way that will very likely steal your heart all over again."
2603,141,Persona 5 Strikers,80,Game Rant,"Feb 10, 2021","Early on in Persona 5's development, P-Studio had considered an action-RPG format for the original Persona 5. While the Phantom Thieves debut maintained Persona's traditional JRPG framework, Persona 5 Strikers showcases what could've been in an overall successful manner. There are kinks that could've been worked out, with battles lacking a significant degree of player feedback that unnecessarily inflating the game's difficulty. Strikers' story also takes a little too long to hit its stride, but it does reward players who stick around for the long haul. Acting as a sequel to the critically acclaimed JRPG, Persona 5 Strikers is a fantastic continuation for the Phantom Thieves."
2604,141,Persona 5 Strikers,80,RPG Site,"Feb  9, 2021","Persona 5 Strikers is the most impressive effort yet from Omega Force to adapt a third-party license into the Musou subgenre. This probably will not be the title that will change the minds of those that already harbor an intense hatred for them, but Persona fans who are on the fence should honestly not miss out on this game. It feels like a proper follow-up to Persona 5 and the story is surprisingly one of its most outstanding feats. The journey is not a 100+ hour ride like the original, but in exchange, its tight narrative is exceptionally more cohesive and the pacing is significantly more palatable. Smart, sensible tweaks have been made across the board to the usual Musou gameplay template to remain faithful to the spirit of Persona 5 and the game is that much stronger for it. If Atlus were to ever revisit the Phantom Thieves again in a new title, whether it be a mainline or spin-off entry, they better include the characters from Persona 5 Strikers. Please? Pretty please?"
2605,141,Persona 5 Strikers,80,PCGamesN,"Feb  9, 2021","The Phantom Thieves arrive on PC in a more streamlined form than the main Persona series, but an equally engaging one that's as stylish as it is action packed."
2606,141,Persona 5 Strikers,71,Riot Pixels,"Apr  1, 2021","All in all, a good second helping for fans of Persona 5. Still, Strikers is a step down compared to the brilliance of the original game."
2607,141,Persona 5 Strikers,70,Cubed3,"Mar 17, 2021","It is hard to say this is a great Persona title. The combat is fun and punchy, the story cool and on point, and there are some attractive design sensibilities. Unfortunately, the overall experience doesn't feel as cohesive as it could. At its core there is a great Persona story and experience but the move to the new systems and Omega Force's take on the series highlights why it is that Persona needs its turn-based combat and carefully considered character narratives. This is an excellent title in its own right and probably Omega Force's best work yet. It's just lacking that special something that would make it a stellar Persona title. It might have worked better as an expansion to the original Persona 5 as the story is awesome."

2611,142,Eldest Souls,90,Hardcore Gamer,"Aug  2, 2021","It’s one thing to craft a game with such an entertaining yet punishing series of fights. It’s another to do so with the kind of design philosophy that’s so quick to convince it more than deserves its rightful place. But that’s exactly what Fallen Flag have achieved with seemingly impeccable ease here. Bold, brilliant and consistently surprising throughout, Eldest Souls’ fresh approach to combat marks one of 2021’s real gems."
2612,142,Eldest Souls,80,IGN,"Aug 24, 2021","Though it wears its overly obvious influences on its sleeve, Eldest Souls is an incredibly satisfying boss rush that still manages to set itself apart. Its brilliant combat is complimented by a smart skill system and some incredible pixel art. Designed with replayability in mind, it’s a little bit of a bummer that its impressive customization doesn’t really blossom until partway into your first playthrough. But one thing that’s there from the start is that feeling of immense glory after every hard-earned victory: Ceremoniously slumping onto the living room floor, clutching the carpet for dear life with one hand while exhaustedly flipping off the television with the other."
2613,142,Eldest Souls,80,Jeuxvideo.com,"Aug  6, 2021","With absolutely sublime pixel art, lively and enjoyable gameplay all of its own as well as a dozen successful bosses and a nice replayability, it's hard to fault Eldest Souls. If you like demanding action games, you are going to be served. Maybe a little too much. To be choosy, we can say that the Fallen Flag studio is sometimes a little too happy on the difficulty."
2614,142,Eldest Souls,80,The Indie Game Website,"Jul 30, 2021","Fans of games like Furi and Devil May Cry may be surprised with how well Eldest Souls can produce the same sort of frantic and expressive action those games are known for. Its “soulslike” credentials don’t stem from replicating the slow and plodding experience that the subgenre is known for very much. Instead, it’s the focused and diverse boss encounters, on top of the snappy combat and clever customisation. Eldest Souls may not change the face of soulslikes just yet, but it at least demonstrates that there are still new ways to interpret them."
2615,142,Eldest Souls,80,PC Invasion,"Jul 29, 2021","Eldest Souls will punish you with its difficulty, but you're going to love it thanks to refreshing combat mechanics and ridiculously frantic boss fights. However, you might encounter a few issues due to visual miscues, and replayability is solely dependent on how much you wish to rerun tougher encounters."
2616,142,Eldest Souls,80,Screen Rant,"Jul 29, 2021","There are some problems in Eldest Souls, though, including weird pathing to certain bosses that require trap-dodging, which just feel out of place. Additionally, the lack of a true pause means re-speccing may require a return to a previous checkpoint. These are ultimately small gripes for what is a wonderful experience overall, as Eldest Souls is a challenging but fair boss-rush with great pixel art and some smart New Game+ content. The Souls community is sure to enjoy this, but the build experimentation and shard system add an appealing sense of growth that makes Eldest Souls feel like it has even broader appeal than its niche."
2617,142,Eldest Souls,78,Multiplayer.it,"Jul 30, 2021","Eldest Souls has an objective: to make us work hard and, finally, leave us with a feeling of satisfaction for the victory. Does it succeed? Yes, but for this reason, it's not a game for everyone."
2618,142,Eldest Souls,75,Gamepressure,"Sep 11, 2021","You want an experience that is so difficult, but rewarding, that it keeps you coming back for more. Eldest Souls fits the bill, but because it focuses on just boss-rushing, it feels more like a lite version that is still just as fun to play. It’s great for those who know what they’re signing up for and are okay with a more minimalistic, if not frustrating approach to a brutal genre."
2619,142,Eldest Souls,70,GameOver.gr,"Aug 27, 2021","The boss fights might drag on a bit more than they should. Nevertheless, the battles are well crafted, offering high challenge but fair. Kudos to the deep progression system, with myriad of options that begs to be implemented in a more extended game."
2620,142,Eldest Souls,70,Checkpoint Gaming,"Aug  9, 2021","I had a great, albeit frustrating time with Eldest Souls and thoroughly enjoyed the short experience. It is a brutally difficult game, but the music, art style, and overall challenge had me coming back for “one last try” each and every time. I will say that if you are not a fan of boss-rush or challenging games, then this will not change that. But if you are after a title with an old-school appeal that does not hold you by the hand and presents a truly captivating time, then I think you will find a lot to enjoy here."
2621,142,Eldest Souls,70,TheGamer,"Jul 30, 2021","Eldest Souls is one of the most beautiful indie games out there but the hurdle to get into it is far too high. The skill points handed out to upgrade your character do little to help while there is no room to learn the mechanics. The notorious Souls difficulty is only amplified in the boss-rush genre, which makes this a near-impossible entry-level game. For anyone who enjoys Dark Souls’ most difficult segments emphatically because of the challenge, Eldest Souls has a lot to love. But that’s just it - Eldest Souls is one for the die-hard fans and no one else."
2622,142,Eldest Souls,67,RPG Fan,"Aug  6, 2021","Eldest Souls has a New Game+ mode where the bosses hit harder, players heal for less, and the enemies have significantly more health — as well as new moves — but who wants to go through that? If you’re hungry for a fresh Souls-like experience, this isn’t it. If you’re the type of player who craves a challenge and loves memorizing boss patterns, then this could be for you. Just don’t expect to have meaningful options."
2623,142,Eldest Souls,60,PC Games,"Sep 26, 2021","The word that describes Eldest Souls best is: painful. The promising core gameplay is buried under a ton of flaws. Horrible controls, a boring story and a non-existent learning curve make it so that not even souls-veterans will like this game."

Stripping the franchise down to its core of exploration and shooting, this DLC could stand alone as its own small but satisfying game."
2629,143,Far Cry 6 - Vaas: Insanity,75,Hobby Consolas,"Nov 17, 2021","We must recognize the first great DLC of Far Cry 6 the effort to offer something different, and from the eyes of one of its most remembered villains. The roguelite mechanics fit well, although it may not appeal to everyone due to the repetition and difficulty. Its small world and little variety of situations make it feel like a missed opportunity."
2630,143,Far Cry 6 - Vaas: Insanity,75,PC Invasion,"Nov 15, 2021","Far Cry 6 Vaas: Insanity provides a deeper and more nuanced look at a troubled character.

2631,143,Far Cry 6 - Vaas: Insanity,70,IGN Italia,"Nov 17, 2021","The roguelite experiment is appreciable because it offers a demanding and satisfying challenge.

2632,143,Far Cry 6 - Vaas: Insanity,68,Gamersky,"Dec  2, 2021","In general, Vaas Insanity is not very playable. After experiencing the limited content, what is waiting for the players is the monotonous content that will no longer attract them. Considering that the next two DLCs will also use the ""Roguelite"" mode, it is a bit worrying. Of course, only from the experience of the first round of play, the quality of this DLC is actually good. The expressiveness of the scene and the design of some levels are very imaginative. For players who want to know more about the story behind Far Cry 3 or are interested in the villain ""Vaas"", this DLC is still worth playing."
2633,143,Far Cry 6 - Vaas: Insanity,67,Everyeye.it,"Nov 15, 2021","Given the redundancy of activities and the lack of variety of situations, Insanity will offer a good amount of hours of play only to those who will be moved by the desire to improve their records or to those players dedicated to completism. All the others will find themselves in front of a more compelling experience on the artistic side than on the strictly playful one. Anyone who has experienced Jason's epic in Far Cry 3, however, will certainly have an added incentive to explore Vaas' insane mind."
2634,143,Far Cry 6 - Vaas: Insanity,60,Screen Rant,"Nov 18, 2021","At the very least, Vaas: Insanity succeeds more than Far Cry 6 proper at moving the franchise forward. By the same token, sanding off the hard edges of a character conceived in a much different world could sever the last few connections to Far Cry's glorious past. The DLC's roguelike structure feels novel but incomplete, another ultimately unsuccessful attempt at mixing things up after Far Cry: New Dawn's RPG elements and Far Cry 5's DLC adventures into new genres. If Ubisoft can do a better job of recapturing the spirit of its other two antagonists in the rest of Far Cry 6's season pass (or in the recently rumored Vaas film project) franchise fans may finally have something to celebrate in 2021."

Sure, simplicity can work wonders, and in the world of puzzle games that has happened many times. Not here, unfortunately, as the progression is extremely slow, as if this is afraid of frightening players, with the few mechanics available being handed to you in an equally slow pace. Is Mischka Kamener's creation bad because of these issues? Far from it. As long as you don't mind NOT being fed with new stuff to remain interested, this is a neat assortment of smart puzzles, that will take some time to be completed, pro or not."

There’s enough depth here that you feel invested in the fate of your character, and even once I finished playing, I kept thinking back to my latest run and what I could do differently."

The game is smooth and solid, and having so much randomly generated content (and so much content to pull from) ensures a different experience on every run-through, even if the gameplay loop gets a little stale sometimes. For a certainly fair price point, players are getting a game they can play a hundred times a hundred different ways.

It’s a punishing experience in the vein of what it must have actually been like back in the day (sans the glowing purple fog and disappearing islands and all that), and one that will absolutely exhaust players as they lose track of time exploring the chain of procedurally generated islands. If you’re very fond of rogue-likes and want to try a unique spin on the genre, Curious Expedition 2 is very likely your cup of Earl Grey; anyone else may want to watch a let’s play or two before spending your hard-plundered riches here."

From the top-down camera perspective to the deliberate lack of instruction from the very beginning, Twelve Minutes wants you to figure everything out for yourself and see just how deep the rabbit hole goes. There are drawbacks to this, as exemplified by my own shortcomings when it comes to puzzle games, but it’s also elegant in its simplicity and minimalism. Twelve Minutes is a deliberately introspective game that doesn’t waste its breath on unnecessary exposition or dialogue. Wanting to see all it has to offer may take some effort on the player’s part, but it’s well worth the hard work and investment."

It can make us feel the entire spectrum of emotions and making us think on how we deal with the truth, while navigating with equal artisanship through various genres.

Its plot, with surprising script twists and told at a very good pace, is actively developed by the player, who has to carefully measure the interactions between objects, the conversations they have and their actions within a time-loop structure based on in the acquisition of knowledge in each attempt. All this in a very accessible game except for some situation that requires an unclear interaction, one of its few black points along with the small technical errors that occur in a fantastic audiovisual section. The first work that Luis Antonio signs as an independent developer is one of those games that have the privilege of staying in our memory."

I was surprised by how quickly it grabbed me, and it maintained that hold until the end. It feels like nearly every loop ends with an exciting cliffhanger that leaves you rushing to start the cycle over again. It can be a bit difficult to maintain focus when you’re stuck on a puzzle and you find yourself beating your head against the wall in search of a solution, but those breakthrough moments are more than worth the trouble."

Then I got frustrated because I got stuck uncovering its hidden complexities. Finally, I can't and don't want to put it down until I'd turned everything over thrice. It executes the time loop mechanic meticulously, its story is twisting and turning constantly, and the excellent voice cast, environmental art, and music work together to create a new type of adventure game. It is not perfect, and you see some cut corners, but what it sacrifices, it makes up for with a satisfying payoff as you delve deeper into its time loop to unravel the mystery at the core."

The voice talents are on point, the gameplay fits remarkably well, and every loop is a new adventure. I implore you to take the time to check this one out, as Twelve Minutes is worth every minute you’ll spend with it."
2668,146,Twelve Minutes,85,PC Invasion,"Aug 18, 2021",Twelve Minutes' strong narrative and star-studded cast of voice actors make it a solid mystery thriller that is slightly held back by clunky movements and occasionally janky controls.
2669,146,Twelve Minutes,85,DualShockers,"Aug 18, 2021","All in all, I really enjoyed the tension Twelve Minutes implemented even with its sometimes wonky animation and frustrating elements. I found myself constantly thinking about it when not playing and trying to come up with new ways and ideas that would allow me to finally get to the crux of what was happening and why. It’s also well worth getting another mind in on the action to help guide the storyline along in angles you haven’t thought about which essentially turns it into a brilliant two-player game and a real talking point."
2670,146,Twelve Minutes,84,The Games Machine,"Aug 25, 2021","Twelve Minutes takes advantage of a time loop to tell us an intricate story, managing to motivate player's creativity in trying to prevent seemingly unavoidable situations. Featuring a breathtaking voiceover, it lacks in credibility when it tries to amaze and horrify at any cost, while successfully managing to blow the audience away. It will give you a fulfilling afternoon, and if you love point and click adventures you shouldn't miss it. You can easily see the first two or three endings, but unlocking them all needs quite an effort."
2671,146,Twelve Minutes,80,CD-Action,"Nov 15, 2021","A test of nerves – the clock is ticking and 12 minutes is a very narrow window to take appropriate actions. It’s kinda hard to rate this game with full conviction, because a lot depends on the player – the more patient and perceptive you are, the better it gets. However, the fact is that it’s one of the most unique adventure games in recent years and that alone makes it worth your time. [11/2021, p.38]"
2672,146,Twelve Minutes,80,Gamepressure,"Sep 11, 2021","Despite its tiny setting and small but robust cast, Twelve Minutes surprisingly grows into a mystery with a lot of depth and intrigue. It does have a few flaws in how it forces you to figure things out on your own and limits how much you can play around with. However, once you do get past those roadblocks and make progress in your search for the truth, you realize those minutes have turned into hours and the disturbing twist at the end was well worth your time."
2673,146,Twelve Minutes,80,PLAY! Zine,"Sep  9, 2021","Twelve Minutes is a welcoming innovation in the video games industry, with a fully fledged all-star cast that does the job masterfully. Sadly it possesses some drawbacks in the form of immense repetitiveness in the later segments, but it shines with its excellently written story and interesting design."
2674,146,Twelve Minutes,80,BaziCenter,"Aug 24, 2021","12 Minutes is a very unique experience with one of a kind art design, solid story and innovative gameplay, and while the time loop mechanism makes some parts of the gameplay repetitive, the final package still feels new, fresh and entertaining."
2675,146,Twelve Minutes,80,Gaming Nexus,"Aug 23, 2021",Twelve Minutes is a nice little point-and-click adventure game that will leave you stunned. Some points of frustration can make the game longer than it needs to be. Can get tedious at times if you're stuck.
2676,146,Twelve Minutes,80,Hardcore Gamer,"Aug 19, 2021","Twelve Minutes features a compelling time loop story with strong performances that will keep players hooked, even when the lack of guidance brings that momentum to a halt. The mysteries of both the plot and gameplay will reward players who are willing to think outside the box, while the intuitive controls ensure that anyone can attempt to help the husband and wife escape their destinies. Fans of adventure games or anyone looking for a memorable story will find plenty to appreciate in the repeating world of Twelve Minutes, and the clock has already begun ticking on the wait for the follow-up to Luis Antonio’s impressive debut title."

2678,146,Twelve Minutes,80,Checkpoint Gaming,"Aug 18, 2021","Twelve Minutes is a game of dualities. It is very economic in how it presents itself. The focus is tight on three characters, in a small apartment that houses the few instruments of change at your disposal. This allows each little detail to have a nauseating amount of depth to it, including the fantastic performances of the characters and their backstories. The downside to this is that it can lead players astray, due to the limitless possibilities and comparatively limited guidance. Regardless, Twelve Minutes is a tidy and reasonably well-told pressure-cooker drama with few divots, provided you can follow the path."
2679,146,Twelve Minutes,80,Destructoid,"Aug 18, 2021","So with every repeated loop, and every new piece of info that leads to more narrative threads to pull on, Twelve Minutes is certainly fascinating to unravel. Some of it might start to feel a bit clunky, when dialogue starts mashing up against itself and characters move in awkward ways, but on the whole, it’s a puzzle I kept wanting to piece together, both fascinated and afraid of the answers I might find. It keeps the story driving forward, and if some deep, dark character drama set in a time loop sounds appealing, you’ll find what you’re looking for here."
2680,146,Twelve Minutes,80,VG247,"Aug 18, 2021","Twelve Minutes ultimately presents a compelling, thrilling experience that feels more than worth the price of entry. It has interesting things to say through its looping core conceit, and it’ll tease your brain more than a few times - sometimes genuinely, sometimes through slightly cheap requirements to progress. I also admit I was less of a fan of where the story went in its later stages - but that doesn’t mean I wasn’t hooked. The journey matters more than the destination, after all - and a gripping journey this is."
2681,146,Twelve Minutes,80,NME,"Aug 18, 2021","Twelve Minutes is a smart take on the time loop concept, reducing both the time and space players operate in to create a pressurised experience. Its puzzles are varied and ingenious, and with all the pieces in front of you from the start, it encourages creative experimentation. There is rough that comes with the smooth, such as some confusing trial and error and tiresome repetition, but even that seems appropriate in the infuriating situation of reliving the same moments again and again."
2682,146,Twelve Minutes,80,Guardian,"Aug 18, 2021","Twelve Minutes is not the first game to explore the concept of the time loop. Zelda, Ephemeral Fantasia and Returnal have all been there. However, as a stylish, twisted take on movies such as Rear Window, Eyes Wide Shut and Chinatown, it is an engrossing experience that marries noir sensibilities and puzzle gameplay into a dense Freudian nightmare."
2683,146,Twelve Minutes,80,IGN,"Aug 18, 2021",Twelve Minutes injects a compelling time-loop mystery into a traditional point-and-click adventure game to create original gameplay that complements its story’s curiosity factor.
2684,146,Twelve Minutes,80,Game Informer,"Aug 18, 2021","Twelve Minutes is ambitious, both in its narrative and gameplay. It restricts players to its brutal rules, and its tragedies truly horrified me. And while its gameplay never let me experiment as much as I wanted it to – I still wish my cup of water plan had worked – I can’t stop thinking about the experience. I don’t want to be trapped in the game’s time loop any longer, but the entire adventure will stick with me. Twelve Minutes is a case study on a game thinking outside the box, playing by its own rules, and it’s a worthwhile experience for that alone."
2685,146,Twelve Minutes,80,Shacknews,"Aug 18, 2021","Twelve Minutes tells a gripping story through a unique, time-jumping point-and-click adventure experience. There’s a sense of thrill working out the narrative based on little clues but, unfortunately, getting this information to the other characters to progress the plot can become a frustrating task of trial-and-error in the last act. Overall, Twelve Minutes is an unforgettable experience that has been worth the wait."
2686,146,Twelve Minutes,80,EGM,"Aug 18, 2021","Twelve Minutes fully embraces its time loop conceit to amp up tension and provide players with a cleverly directed puzzle to solve. Discovering the whos and whys of the game’s central event in bite-sized increments is just as satisfying as interacting with its simple adventure-style interface. Its A-list casting and unanswered plot elements might distract from the overall package, but at its core, Twelve Minutes is a satisfying thriller that asks some dark and disturbing moral questions."
2687,146,Twelve Minutes,80,Screen Rant,"Aug 18, 2021","For the majority of its runtime Twelve Minutes is a delight, with its engaging premise and unique gameplay making the player lose track of those never-ending loops, but it does peter out towards the end."
2688,146,Twelve Minutes,75,JeuxActu,"Nov 24, 2021","Used to atypical games, the publisher Annapurna Interactive surprises us once again with Twelve Minutes. Yes indeed the game has some rigid animations, not really worthy in 2021, game is quite short, and the system of dialogues isn't perfect, but the stifling atmosphere, the atypical staging, the surprising scenario and the puzzles are really worth the detour in our opinion."
2689,146,Twelve Minutes,75,Vgames,"Nov 15, 2021","Twelve Minutes is a niche game that won't suit everyone unless you are in it for finding every single detail. I couldn't explain to you why this game is really good without spoiling it to you. It could get repetitive and it's soundtrack is forgettable, but the cast of actors will make it all worthwhile."
2690,146,Twelve Minutes,75,RPG Fan,"Aug 31, 2021","Twelve Minutes is an exercise in patience and the thrill of discovery. Many will tap out before discovering all of the endings or the true ending, whatever that is. I tossed in the towel after about six hours because I passed a point-of-no-return that the game alluded to but didn’t make it explicitly clear to me. The idea of having to redo everything I had already done was unthinkable, so I quit. I had gotten a couple of endings at that point, so I was satisfied enough. I imagine this will be a title that enthusiasts will speculate on and theorize over for a long while, while others will pass on it in frustration as it leaves a bad taste in their mouths. Although not totally satisfying, I’m glad I played it, and I think for the right person, this is a rewarding and thought-provoking adventure."
2691,146,Twelve Minutes,75,Multiplayer.it,"Aug 18, 2021","12 Minutes is a game that proves to have a great story and an equally valid idea behind it, however the implementation in terms of gameplay does not always work and the freedom given to the player collides many times against an artificial wall, leading to conclusions sometimes illogical. Consequently, the narrative also suffers this backlash, since above all the policeman (and in rare cases also the wife) are bent to the need for the ""game over"" and are inconsistent or too forced in some of their behaviors. It's a shame, because the twists are certainly not lacking and the evolution of the story is growing, but also thanks to the fact that the events must follow a specific course and the clues are not so clear, the loops accumulate with a lot of frequency."
2692,146,Twelve Minutes,70,KeenGamer,"Sep 17, 2021","Twelve Minutes has great potential as a high concept thriller with its stellar technical design, critically acclaimed cast and initially organic gameplay, but ultimately its narrative direction and pacing leaves a lot to be desired."

2695,146,Twelve Minutes,70,COGconnected,"Aug 24, 2021","While I was intrigued by the narrative, and enjoyed the performances, Twelve Minutes was an experience I’d had enough of by the time I completed it. There are just enough seams, jank, and clunk around that the act of playing the game felt like a task at times. I absolutely applaud the effort though. Twelve Minutes is an audacious first crack at a unique narrative structure, and one that will certainly lead to more refined and robust takes on this style of experience."
2696,146,Twelve Minutes,70,Noisy Pixel,"Aug 24, 2021","Twelve Minutes is an engrossing adventure that is more about the journey than the destination. It’s not the most thrilling or thought-provoking story out there, but it still satiates that mystery craving. The star-studded casting elevates the atmosphere, and the involvement of the player is a unique way to take on the classic point-and-click genre. Though you’ll have to suffer through lengthy moments of tedium and irritation, there’s a lot to unpack and discover in this intriguing tale."
2697,146,Twelve Minutes,70,Jeuxvideo.com,"Aug 22, 2021","Combined with a concept that is both seductive and risky, the plot of 12 Minutes easily maintains interest even in its elements of resolution. Also if one feels Luis Antonio's imperfections in terms of technique, his learning from the great thrillers of cinema is just as visible. But the title divides between the frustration that can cause redundant loops and the quite captivating atmosphere of the place. If the game is as accessible in its mechanics as thorny in its timed puzzles, the experience will naturally be smoother for those able to progress by limiting loops."
2698,146,Twelve Minutes,70,We Got This Covered,"Aug 19, 2021","At times maddening, but always fascinating, Twelve Minutes is a unique vision worth experiencing. It blends disparate genres and explores a twisting narrative using a terrarium of the mundane."
2699,146,Twelve Minutes,70,Everyeye.it,"Aug 18, 2021","Twelve Minutes represents a videogame experiment born from a series of suggestive intuitions. The choice of setting the title within the confines of a small two-room apartment, combined with the mystery that constantly permeates the work, certainly represents one of the most valuable aspects of the Indie published by Annapurna Interactive. Unfortunately, a scarce malleability, the limited possibilities of interaction and a narrative evolution that makes excessive use of artificial solutions prevent Luis Antonio's work from fully expressing its starting potential."
2700,146,Twelve Minutes,70,Windows Central,"Aug 18, 2021","There's a lot to like in Twelve Minutes, but when you start to get into the puzzles at the core of the game, things begin to get bogged down."
2701,146,Twelve Minutes,70,Press Start Australia,"Aug 18, 2021","When Twelve Minutes hits, it hits hard. But I feel there’s, at times, such a disconnect between what it wants to do and say that it’s hard to reconcile its moving parts into anything I’d consider truly great. Performances waver as often as they wow, and that’s a result of a very ambitious game. Narratively speaking, it’s got the hallmarks of a Nolan film, and just like any good Nolan film, you’re going to boil the kettle and postulate into the midnight hours."
2702,146,Twelve Minutes,70,Digital Trends,"Aug 18, 2021","12 Minutes is something unique and experimental, and like any experiment, there are going to be some hiccups. As it turns out, this game’s main fault was that it, by its nature, rips time from its players. But between those moments, it tells a brilliant story, one in which you can go back to any chapter and decide to do a rewrite. 12 Minutes certainly won’t be for everyone, but if you’re looking for a change of pace, the game comes recommended highly."
2703,146,Twelve Minutes,69,SpazioGames,"Aug 22, 2021","Twelve Minutes is a clever and well written psychological thriller, but in the end it chooses to abandon the logic and forces the player to act in a forced way."

2706,146,Twelve Minutes,65,Gamer.nl,"Aug 26, 2021","Twelve Minutes is an indie game that has been eagerly anticipated for years, mainly due to its unique concept. A man is stuck in a twelve-minute time loop and it's up to you to adjust little things and steer events in a different direction. In practice, that idea appears to lend itself less well to a game than hoped."
2707,146,Twelve Minutes,65,MGG,"Aug 20, 2021","The excellent atmosphere and the cinematographic ambitions of Twelve Minutes are not enough to make it an unforgettable experience. Underneath lies a sloppy point & click game, serving a disjointed plot with far from captivating stakes.

It has a great concept and good plot delivery, but actual gameplay is incredibly frustrating. You’re stuck in the loop along with your character, with no way to fast-forward the events, and you have to meticulously try every possible combination, until find the trigger that will open up a new option. And then you re-check it all over again. [Issue#256, p.44]"

But just as it quickly captivates the player with the tantalising promise to unravel all its mysteries, it also loses all that steam just as rapidly with its unbelievable twists and unspeakable violence, resulting in a conclusion that’s as mind-boggling as it’s nauseating. In the end, Twelve Minutes can’t seem to rise above its film influences, as it grinds to an unsatisfying, disconcerting halt."
2713,146,Twelve Minutes,60,GameSpew,"Aug 18, 2021","In the end, I enjoyed some of my time with Twelve Minutes. Its story is genuinely gripping, and the cast’s performances are excellent, solidifying the game as a believable world. In many ways, developer Luis Antonio has created something truly remarkable here. But so much of Twelve Minutes is an exercise in frustration and repetition. You’re going to need a lot of patience to keep going, and ultimately, I’m not sure if it’s entirely worth it."
2714,146,Twelve Minutes,60,TheGamer,"Aug 18, 2021","Twelve Minutes is a good adventure game, but its puzzle design makes it feel— mature, cinematic presentation aside—like something of a relic. If it was released in 1995, you'd be ringing up the LucasArts hint line for help and getting scolded by your parents for running up a massive phone bill. But it has its charms, and the way the story is gradually peeled back, growing more disturbing with each loop, is effectively done. There's a huge amount of emotion, drama, and conflict squeezed into this tiny, dingy three-room apartment. But also a lot of frustration as you struggle to determine precisely the correct sequence of events to let you move the story forward and finally get some closure."
2715,146,Twelve Minutes,55,Riot Pixels,"Nov 19, 2021","Since 12 Minutes locks us in the confines of a small apartment, one would expect a high level of interactivity and variety, but after a few time loops you realize that you’re given a very limited set of useful actions.

Everything is well-designed and polished in Days Gone – the believable world and characters in it, the distinct post-apocalyptic aura, the crafting, the thrilling combat and spectacular encounters with bloodthirsty hordes. In addition, this version is well-optimized and runs smoothly on a mid-range PC. [08/2021, p.48]"
2718,147,Days Gone,90,GameCritics,"Jun  9, 2021","For my money, Days Gone remains one of the absolute best open-world games on the market, and now more people will have the opportunity to try it out for themselves as it puts its best foot forward. That’s something worth celebrating, I think."
2719,147,Days Gone,90,GamingTrend,"May 17, 2021","Days Gone is the perfect PlayStation game to make its way to PC. It was already a beautiful game, but held back by the PS4 and PS4 Pro. On PC, Days Gone gets it’s chance to flourish, running at uncapped frame rates, high resolutions, and touting an FOV slider. While it is missing some cool next-gen upgrades like ray tracing and DLSS, Days Gone runs nearly flawlessly on PC, and serves as a testament to Bend’s tradecraft. Even if you’ve already played the game on PS4 or PS4 Pro, it’s worth jumping back into the shoes of Deacon St John on PC to massacre a freaker horde at the highest level of performance possible."
2720,147,Days Gone,90,GameSkinny,"May 17, 2021","If you're still without a PS5 and never got around to Days Gone before, understand that it's not a game that breaks the mold of the massive sandboxes we've seen so many times before. But what Days Gone does right is that it gives players a world where nothing comes easily. Dozens of hours into my multiple playthroughs, I still evade even just a small group of Freakers if I can. But overcoming those struggles and making something out of the new world is always the lifeblood of great zombie fiction, and though Sony Bend gives its monsters a different name, Days Gone is one of the best genre video games ever produced."
2721,147,Days Gone,88,Worth Playing,"May 19, 2021","Days Gone is a long and slow burn that is well worth it. It tells a relatable story that feels grounded, and the later stages have some truly memorable moments, both in terms of story and gameplay. With all previous DLC included, some nice improvements for PC gamers, and the capability to run at high frame rates, the PC iteration of Days Gone is the definitive version to play."
2722,147,Days Gone,88,The Games Machine,"May 17, 2021","Days Gone provides a good challenge and an interesting story, which should make PC users really happy about this port from PS4.

Some little quirks here and there, but it will keep you busy slaughtering monsters for a while."
2723,147,Days Gone,85,Gaming Nexus,"May 25, 2021","Minus ray-tracing support, Days Gone on PC brings a lot of goodies that PC gamers look for. There's 60 Hz refresh rates, unlimited frames per second, ultrawide resolutions, HDR, and even an increased field of view. The technical aspects of this port are solid, even if I have to do a framey 360 spin with the camera whenever I first load up."
2724,147,Days Gone,83,Gaming Age,"May 18, 2021","Ultimately, if you played Days Gone and it didn’t click with you before, it probably won’t now. Like I said, it is not a perfect game. The story is not very deep, side characters can be a joke at times, the game tends to meander on its way to the real plot points, etc. None of this is changed with the PC release, but the performance is leaps and bounds beyond what it was on the PS4. If you never had a chance to play it back in 2019, or just skipped out on it for whatever reason, the PC version is the absolute best way to play Days Gone."

So it is a very good entertaining proposal, but, at the same time, disposable."
2726,147,Days Gone,82,4Players.de,"May 18, 2021","The PC port of Days Gone is technically way more stable than Horizon Zero Dawn, probably because it uses Unreal technology. Having said that, the action-adventure in an apocalyptic biker world is still good entertainment."

It doesn’t go above and beyond by delivering anything extra, and some additional features such as DLSS support would have been nice, but as it is, it performs just fine. Stick with it past its mediocre first few hours, and Days Gone is an excellent open world adventure. Beautiful yet bleak in equal measure, its world is a pleasure to explore – and once it gets going, its story won’t let you go."
2743,147,Days Gone,80,But Why Tho?,"May 17, 2021","Days Gone on the PC is a great experience that brings a stellar upgrade for graphics that take full advantage of the dynamic weather system. And, with a much smoother ride than it got on console, this is well worth the buy for PC-players looking to get in on zombie action. While it definitely plays better on a controller, the experience is still a great one."
2744,147,Days Gone,80,Noisy Pixel,"May 17, 2021","If you're going to play Days Gone, do yourself a favor and play it on PC. There's a decent level of options here for PC players to fine-tune their experience and even quality-of-life features missing from other PC-only titles. The story can be messy, but the more you progress, the clearer the intent of this staggered narrative becomes. The level of immersion is high in some areas, but Days Gone knows when to be a game and when to challenge the player's patience with mundane systems. This game is a must for survival action fans."
2745,147,Days Gone,80,Areajugones,"May 17, 2021","Days Gone lands on PC as the second PlayStation Studios exclusive to make the multiplatform leap. The port has no major issues, hence providing a remarkable adventure with Deacon at the helm. Whether you have a PC fully prepared for top performance or a more modest one, the fact remains that the Days Gone port is a pretty recommendable experience."
2746,147,Days Gone,80,Game Revolution,"May 17, 2021","Thanks to the technical improvements, Days Gone is better than ever on PC. It still has the issues with pacing that irritated us in our original review, but the faster loading times at least help a bit...Days Gone is worth checking out for anyone who wants an open-world, post-apocalyptic, story-driven adventure and doesn’t mind a bit of filler. The slow start might turn off some players, but those who stick it out will find an engaging story and an interesting spin on the zombie horror genre."
2747,147,Days Gone,76,Merlin'in Kazanı (Turkey),"May 17, 2021",Days Gone manages to be a good open world game no matter how poor its storytelling. The transition to PC is quite successful.
2748,147,Days Gone,75,Vgames,"May 18, 2021","This is simply a great port of a fairly overlooked game. Though more graphical settings would've been nice, and there are several (but minor) bugs and glitches, this PC port does more right than wrong. Even with the PS5 version showing massive improvements in FPS and load times, this is the best version you can find."
2749,147,Days Gone,75,MGG,"May 18, 2021","Although Days Gone has hardly changed since its release in 2019, the game is still quite enjoyable, with both original and generic gameplay ideas. The intrinsic qualities of its storyline and open-world will undoubtedly push the player to explore its environment and study its world. Despite this, it's impossible to get over the major physics and texture loading issues that have not yet been corrected and that greatly harm the gameplay experience. However, the game can already boast of being more accomplished and therefore more fun than two years ago. Which earns it a slightly higher score than it did then, but we can only hope that the game will benefit from patches in order to be able to offer a better experience."

There are definitely better games out there, but without a doubt, Days Gone is a perfectly entertaining title to waste a week in."
2751,147,Days Gone,75,Jeuxvideo.com,"May 17, 2021","Days Gone PC is undoubtedly the ultimate version of the title from Bend Studio. With more detailed textures and lighting effects that gain credibility, Deacon's adventure asserts itself, and becomes a little more realistic and immersive. Two years after its release on PS4, the post-apocalyptic open world is rid of the bugs that hampered its launch, and the adventure is more fluid, with almost instantaneous load times during the transitions between gameplay and cinematic as on PS5. , if you have an SSD."
2752,147,Days Gone,70,IGN Portugal,"Jul  5, 2021","The PC version of Days Gone manages to be a superior experience. More polished and better performing than the original on PS4. It doesn't escape its sins however – a story with an uneven pace associated with repetitive and sometimes unnecessary mechanics. The game would benefit if some mechanics were simplified, but it is still a very solid option for those who like open worlds, motorcycles and zombies."
2753,147,Days Gone,70,MMORPG.com,"May 24, 2021","Riding along the Oregon mountain side is pretty fun if you aren’t on chase missions, and there’s nothing more satisfying than the instant stealth kills, watching Deacon dig his knife into the spine of a freaker and pull it straight down. If nothing else, Days Gone is a good game that’ll hold you over while waiting for that next game."
2754,147,Days Gone,70,TheGamer,"May 18, 2021","If you're not sick of long open-world games or stories about zombies, then you should be able to squeeze some enjoyment out of this. Days Gone might be a ride that goes on for too long, but it's a mostly worthwhile journey with a few good stops along the way."
2755,147,Days Gone,70,Gameblog.fr,"May 18, 2021","Days Gone on PC offers a visually pleasing experience and solid in its entirety, thus erasing the few technical mistakes of the PS4 version. It is pleasant to follow the tribulations of Deacon St John for several hours, despite some black spots like the AI, the repetitiveness of the missions and the bestiary which is sorely lacking in variety. However, this does not prevent Bend Studio from offering a technically successful title."
2756,147,Days Gone,70,Attack of the Fanboy,"May 17, 2021","Days Gone has its high points and the open world looks better than ever, even if it is still filled with by-the-books gameplay systems and inconsistent execution."
2757,147,Days Gone,70,Shindig,"May 17, 2021","Beneath all the new technical capabilities and extra DLC features, the core of Days Gone on PC is still Days Gone, for better and worse. It’s a game that can be a lot of fun to play in the moment, with a good balance between stealth, action, and exploration and the exhilaration that comes with fighting its zombie hordes. But it’s also a game that struggles to stand out from a very crowded room; that despite its story-driven focus and early signs of promise, ends up tracing all the same cliches as every other zombie outing before it."
2758,147,Days Gone,65,Game Over Online,"Jun  2, 2021","A game with a fundamentally really messed up economy in a lot of ways (money, trust, gas, ammunition, motorcycle repair – none of it works right) wrapped around a so-so open world zombie combat sandbox. I think more than anything else, it makes me want to play more Dying Light."
2759,147,Days Gone,63,PC Gamer,"May 17, 2021","Riding and maintaining your bike is great—the boring world, dull missions, and overly serious tone, not so much."
2760,147,Days Gone,60,PLAY! Zine,"Jun  8, 2021","Days Gone PC port is a good and much better day 1 experience than Horizon Zero Dawn was. However, HZD has one leg up on Days Gone – it is fun. This cookie-cutter zombie game offers little innovation or fun experiences except in set pieces and a couple of quests. You will be fighting the same zombies and burning nests throughout the game, but hey, it looks and works really nice on PC."
2761,147,Days Gone,60,Metro GameCentral,"May 21, 2021","The game itself is as generic and unmemorable as ever, and does little to deserve talk of a sequel, but this is a notably better PC port than Sony’s first attempt."
2762,147,Days Gone,50,Gfinity,"Jun  2, 2021","In a world where zombies are so commonplace and people are the real monsters, Days Gone does not stand on its own two legs very well. While mechanically sound, the game lacks life, similar to the Freakers that inhabit it."
2763,147,Days Gone,40,Het Nieuwsblad,"Jun  8, 2021","Bigger is better. It might suit a bag of chips - Lay's salt and pepper, please - but not a computer game. Or at least not for Days Gone for PC, which combines the same large open world of the PS4 game with an overwhelming number of missions.  Do we think Days Gone is a bad game? No, absolutely not. But to go back to the comparison with potato chips - one of our areas of expertise next to computer games - the bag is big, the content is weak."
2764,148,OMNO,85,CD-Action,"Oct 12, 2021","Jonas Manke accomplished something incredible. The game he spent five long years creating on his own is relaxing, enjoyable, and above all surprisingly full-bodied. It looks and sounds great, there are no technical issues, and it can compete with titles developed by larger, more experienced teams in pretty much every aspect. It’s a great little game that I wholeheartedly recommend. [10/2021, p.42]"
2765,148,OMNO,80,Adventure Gamers,"Oct 27, 2021","Far more action-oriented than a traditional point-and-click, Omno feels like a true “adventure” in the literal sense, offering a jaw-dropping journey of enlightenment that is sure to brighten any gamer’s day."

Simply put, Omno is an enjoyable journey through a magical world, where so many other games would fill such a setting with chaos."
2768,148,OMNO,80,Shacknews,"Jul 29, 2021","Omno is an incredibly peaceful yet thoughtful adventure through the remnants of a lost civilization. The inviting nature of it all, coupled with the world’s diversity and vast array of creatures makes it one worth exploring. Though I had some issues with platforming, there’s enough there to make Omno quite an enjoyable experience."
2769,148,OMNO,78,Multiplayer.it,"Jul 29, 2021","Omno is a small creature capable of challenging giants. The awareness of its contained nature, even if not flawlessly, makes the game shine compared to most of today's video game productions."

2772,148,OMNO,70,Checkpoint Gaming,"Aug  5, 2021","Omno is an enjoyable and visually beautiful experience. While there are some elements of the gameplay that feel lacking and where you’ll feel like you’re taking a backseat, it accomplishes what it sets out to do with its relaxed approach to puzzles and exploration. It will give you an atmospheric adventure to immerse yourself in for a few hours, and maybe as a bonus, leave you with a nice warm fuzzy feeling. And sometimes, that’s just what you’re looking for."
2773,148,OMNO,70,IGN France,"Jul 29, 2021","Simple, intriguing and fresh, Omno is a good indie game, pretty short, rich with colors and diversity, a light and airy environment that let you explore its world. Very pleasant."
2774,148,OMNO,65,Jeuxvideo.com,"Aug  6, 2021","At first, Jonas Manke, with Omno, takes a seductive initiatory journey that we love to discover. Exploring this colorful universe offering pretty panoramas and inhabited by curious animals is a pleasure at all times, especially if our hero has all the possible improvements. But at first, the player must necessarily deal with a more capricious gameplay, with strange inertia, and face a formula that is struggling to renew itself."
2775,149,Chorus,90,GameGrin,"Dec 20, 2021","Chorus is a veritable smorgasbord of action, exploration, and captivating story. One that I’ll enjoy for many moons to come."
2776,149,Chorus,90,Hooked Gamers,"Dec 14, 2021","Chorus is a fun space shooter adventure that seems to fill a void in the 3D space combat genre of computer games. Other than maybe a Star Wars themed spin off game there doesn't seem to be many pure space shooters available. Fortunately, Deep Silver has the resources and the time to give fans a good game where “flying a space fighter with the intent on blasting other space fighters into oblivion” is the main objective. Chorus is a very solid game where the pluses outweigh the negatives. One negative might be that the boss fights seem to be overly difficult with some of the later ones dragging on a bit too long. The flight model is smooth in nature and might take a bit of finesse to master. Overall, Chorus is a very well-done game, and we would recommend it."
2777,149,Chorus,90,GameCritics,"Dec  6, 2021","By the time I rolled credits, there was no doubt that Chorus was the best space combat game I’ve played in years. The thrill of dynamic space combat coupled with a compelling narrative and overall superb design make this one an absolute a must-play."
2778,149,Chorus,85,GamingTrend,"Dec  3, 2021","With incredible combat, a solid story and voice acting, and gorgeous graphics from top to bottom, the handful of bugs in Chorus can’t hold it back. Come for the story, and stay for the high-speed power drift as you unleash your vengeance."

2780,149,Chorus,80,IGN,"Dec  6, 2021","Chorus does an excellent job of cutting out the dull parts of space dogfighting, getting right to the flashy fun of blasting through enemy fighters and capital ships with superpowered abilities. Its large and pretty map is filled with fleshed-out side quests, and they’re varied enough that it’s easy to cruise around for a few dozen hours and really get the hang of the combat system. The story behind it all isn’t half bad once you’ve waded through a flood of sci-fi mysticism, and Nara and Forsaken are interesting characters to spend all that time with – which is a relief, because they’re the only ones we ever get to see."
2781,149,Chorus,80,Slant Magazine,"Dec  3, 2021","Few space shooters are as dedicated as Chorus is to making such an impact as an engrossing, thoughtful adventure."
2782,149,Chorus,80,PC Games,"Dec  3, 2021","There is always something fascinating about space. If it's done as well as in Chorus, I would love to just fly around and explore the star systems. But in a shooter, of course, the fights are in the foreground and luckily they work flawlessly."
2783,149,Chorus,80,Gamepressure,"Dec  3, 2021",Chorus is a very fun and satisfying space combat adventure. The controls are smooth and forgiving while the combat is fast-paced and engaging. Where Chorus unfortunately falters is an over-centralization on the dark and dramatic main story that can often leave little room for the player to insert themselves into the place of the main character or make choices that feel impactful to the surrounding world.
2784,149,Chorus,75,SECTOR.sk,"Jan 24, 2022","Chorus is an epic space expedition with some great components, but some weak points as well. All this does not mean that you will not enjoy it, but do not expect anything special from it"
2785,149,Chorus,75,TrueGaming,"Dec  9, 2021","Chorus has smooth and engaging combat with crisp visuals and a unique soundtrack. The experience wasn't perfect though, the story was plain, and the content lacked variety. It is a fun arcade shooter for those who look for great combat mechanics and don't mind the weak narrative."
2786,149,Chorus,75,MGG,"Dec  3, 2021","The space battles in Chorus are good, piloting its agile super-powered fighter through enemy fire while devastating hordes of enemies is fun. This efficient gameplay is its strength, and the special powers are well integrated into the gameplay. The fights tend to become too easy, but the boss battles compensate. The exploration is unfortunately not there as the open world is empty, it is more an excuse for dialogues and additional battles. However, it has the merit of being very pleasant to look at. The realization is quite good, whether it is through the graphics, the music, and even the cinematics and dialogues. So, we spend a good time on Chorus, during the twenty hours to finish it the first time."
2787,149,Chorus,70,Jeuxvideo.com,"Feb  1, 2022","Despite a few flaws, in particular with regard to the structure of the scenario, the excessive presence of dialogues, an insignificant soundtrack and framerate drops, Chorus is the nice surprise of the end of 2021."

2790,149,Chorus,70,Shacknews,"Dec  3, 2021","It doesn’t break new ground in the genre and, apart from a nifty battle with a monster space eel, lacks many standout moments. That said, space action junkies will eat this one up and those with next-gen consoles that are new-game-thirsty could do much worse than this interstellar tale of redemption."
2791,149,Chorus,68,Game World Navigator Magazine,"Feb  7, 2022","What would happen if you take a mobile game concept and scale it up to a PC release? Well, Fishlabs tried it with Chorus, and the results are rather mediocre. [Issue#258, p.62]"
2792,149,Chorus,60,Wccftech,"Dec  3, 2021","Chorus is undoubtedly ambitious, with Fishlabs undeniably putting in a lot of effort into their first full title. Aesthetically, there's a lot to praise the game for, with a photo mode that genuinely feels useful to capture the visual splendour of space and the action of combat. Combat here is also fun, responsive, and generally great to play, even if it can feel overused due to a significant lack of variety in the rest of the game. Add this lack of variety to an ambitious story, but poorly developed, and you get Chorus. For every positive, there is an undeniable negative. Is it worth playing? I would say yes, but how much mileage you get out of it will be very subjective."
2793,149,Chorus,50,PC Invasion,"Dec  3, 2021","Chorus is a game that works in the sense that it doesn't crash your desktop, but it's just an ambulatory shell with mere vestiges of soul left in it."

It forces you to be slow and deliberate. It rewards you for making the most use of your physical play area as you slip out of harm's way or sniff out Barclay Mansion's many secrets. It also hosts a cast of interesting characters, and each of its monstrous specters has a fascinating backstory to seek out."
2795,150,Wraith: The Oblivion - Afterlife,82,Impulsegamer,"Jun  1, 2021","Ultimately this is a horror game that I almost don’t mind playing… that is to say there are certainly horror elements (it’s not fun trying to escape a spectre), but there’s also a compelling story and a quite well set out world to explore. There are enough moments of exploration without direct terror to give you a chance to breathe… but then you are subjected to nightmare material again. If you like horror games then this is definitely worth a look."

I’m a bit sensitive when it comes to VR games, but luckily this title has both a standing and sitting mode, so I could play a little bit longer without feeling nauseous. There are some quirks here and there, but none of the things I mentioned above ever really took me out of the immersion of the experience itself. Some horror fans may not like the consistently slow pace you have to keep up with for the entirety of the game, but for those who don’t mind taking things nice and slow while being scared out of your wits, Wraith: The Oblivion – Afterlife is certainly for you."

While it’s not completely plain sailing as the Oculus Quest 2 did at points look to struggle a little with objects occasionally popping up out of nowhere, the atmosphere and tension the whole experience creates make this a worthy horror title. Coming in at around eight hours of nail-biting content, Wraith: The Oblivion – Afterlife does the World of Darkness proud."

Or, more selfishly, I’m not going to say anything that could dial back its fear factor; if you’re going to play this, you’re going to be as scared as me, dammit.

2800,150,Wraith: The Oblivion - Afterlife,80,UploadVR,"Apr 22, 2021","Hooking us in with an intriguing story, Afterlife’s a strong VR debut for the World of Darkness universe. Offering a faithful adaptation that Wraith: The Oblivion fans will enjoy and a solid introduction to newcomers, it doesn’t rely on cheap jump scares, creating a disturbing atmosphere which plays to VR’s strengths well. Sadly, Afterlife’s slower paced gameplay won’t suit everyone but for survival horror fans, we’d recommend taking a look."

2808,150,Wraith: The Oblivion - Afterlife,40,TheGamer,"Apr 25, 2021","While the VR medium definitely makes the game scarier, there’s absolutely nothing about Wraith that wouldn’t have worked just the same in a normal game. The hide-in-seek genre of horror games has been done to death, and Wraith would have been much better served by more scripted encounters, on rails scares, and fewer (or no) fail states. Once a monster catches you and sends you back to your last save, it loses almost all of its power to scare you. Wraith stopped being scary when it started being tedious. It’s one of the most disappointing horror games I’ve played because I loved the way it started, but its strong introductions never developed into anything more compelling."

The beautiful artwork and detail of each level enhance the deep, story-rich world. Beyond the graphics, players of all ages can enjoy engaging puzzles and a robust crafting system that help them interact with the environment and access new areas to explore. The Pikmin-like mechanic with spritelings is innovative for this particular genre, and it works well for the story and characters. Fans of indie adventure and puzzle games should consider crossing into the Deep Woods to join Wake and Kirby on this memorable journey."

The immersive and detailed storytelling and intuitive gameplay make The Wild at Heart a beautifully crafted showpiece. Whilst some of the gameplay further into the experience can feel repetitive and some mechanics are either underutilised or unnecessary, this is still a game worth sharing with people of all ages as it offers unique experiences for each player. Moonlight Kids have done an amazing job creating this unique and wonderful world and the story within. If you are an avid lover of puzzle adventure games that involve weird and wonderful creatures, coming of age stories, battles against supernatural foes and uncovering secrets, then The Wild at Heart is something you absolutely must experience for yourself."

Together with inviting art direction that suggests an animated storybook and a story that supports layers of meaning, The Wild at Heart was a pleasant discovery. The game’s combat and puzzles aren’t entirely consistent or satisfying, and moment to moment the experience can feel a little aimless, but fans of accessible puzzle and action games with heart and some emotional depth should check it out."

The somewhat hazy story is okay at best and even though the game showers you with crafting materials, the crafting itself is pretty much needless, but the game’s biggest problem is the repetitiveness that made me slightly weary.

Clear your mind of the excessive mechanics, though, and it’s still a cute and enjoyable ode to the likes of Pikmin that still might be worth your time. It’s not as traumatizing a journey as the truly classic childhood adventures are, but its spectacular world and impressive graphics make it quite the charming adventure instead."

The puzzles aren’t challenging, but they serve as an acceptable means to an end of pointing players where to go. The colors and tones of Fall present a cute, yet somber accent to the bittersweet plot of running away to a hopefully better place. Wake is provided with actions that are unique to him, such as his vacuum ability, but it doesn’t quite elevate the game to surpassing genre conventions. Potential buyers should focus on whether the mysterious environments and curious characters entice them, rather than the simply adequate puzzle elements."

The game also has plenty of long-term goals. But once I learned more about the monsters and the enemies I found it hard to get excited, even when I got a new powerful creature or when a powerful hero dropped in.

Interviewing witnesses and potential suspects is a chance for players to more actively engage with its branching dialogue systems and focus on Obsidian’s knack for writing bizarre, loveable, and hilarious characters that appropriately skewer corporate capitalism.

The progression-based game flow, the fantastic visuals and soundtrack, and the same problems bar one.

As for the rest, the game may offer a few hours of quality fun with friends and that is it."
2897,157,Scott Pilgrim vs. the World: The Game - Complete Edition,70,GameSpot,"Jan 15, 2021","Though I had my fun with the original game 10 years ago and had moved on, I still found coming back to the core loop and flow of Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game to be a satisfying romp. It's not often to see games that get pulled from circulation get a second chance, yet the Complete Edition more than makes the case that this cult favorite beat-'em-up has earned another shot. While much has changed over the last decade when it comes to geek-appeal and retro gaming appeal, what's here is still a solid beat-'em-up that's gotten mostly better with age."
2898,157,Scott Pilgrim vs. the World: The Game - Complete Edition,70,TheGamer,"Jan 15, 2021","I will say that Ubisoft’s rerelease of Scott Pilgrim is relying a lot more on nostalgia than other recent beat ‘em ups. I’d still think something like Streets of Rage 4 is a fine game on its own even in the absence of Streets of Rage 1 through 3, while Scott Pilgrim might not have the same appeal to someone who’s never read the comics, seen the movie, or played the game back in 2010."

Still, just like Scott himself, the game makes up for this with whimsical creativity, offbeat humour, and absurd storytelling."
2900,158,Tormented Souls,93,Digital Chumps,"Sep  2, 2021","Tormented Souls gets way more right than not, and I came away from it very impressed. This was the kind of game that once I got the hang of it (I have not played many survival horror games at all) I became enthralled with playing and exploring every area and uncovering all the secrets and story material I could. This game does not try to advance the genre; it doesn’t do anything particularly new or better than previous champions of the genre have, but for all that it does, it does it very well. I’ll always say there is room in any genre for another solid entry, and that’s what you get here — a great survival horror game built with intentional classic/retro design."
2901,158,Tormented Souls,85,Game Revolution,"Sep  3, 2021","Tormented Souls is the successor to classic survival horror. I’ve wanted a new Silent Hill (or classic Resident Evil) game for years, but I’d trade all the drama and disappointment for a fantastic spiritual successor like this any day. Exploring Winterlake Hospital channeled all those feelings of dread and loneliness that made those games special and proves that the format still works.
The biggest issues with Tormented Souls seem like they stem more from a problem with budget more than the devs’ ability. With indie games, there are always compromises that have to be made to launch a title, and I think Dual Effect struck the best balance it could here."

2904,158,Tormented Souls,80,Gamers' Temple,"Sep 14, 2021","Even though the game is inspired by old-school horror titles, it is still very much its own thing. The game has a lot of its own ideas and feels unique even with its similarities. If you’re an old-school survival horror fan, you need to buy Tormented Souls. This game was created exclusively with you in mind. With the game’s value price, it’s quite amazing the amount of content in the game. If only this game had more replay value to it, it would be a super solid experience. Even without that, it’s a very fun tread through the type of survival horrors that we used to enjoy back when the genre was still young."
2905,158,Tormented Souls,79,Ragequit.gr,"Sep 26, 2021","Boasting good puzzles and solid level design, Tormented Souls doesn't break new ground, but it does well what it set out to do. It's not a game I would recommend to everyone since you have to get used to the clunky combat and the lack of guidance and be equipped with enough patience to overcome the initial difficulty barrier."
2906,158,Tormented Souls,75,GamingTrend,"Aug 20, 2021","Tormented Souls feels like a labor of love, paying homage to its predecessors and delivering a survival horror experience akin to the games of the genre’s glory days in the PlayStation 2 era of gaming.

2908,158,Tormented Souls,72,Multiplayer.it,"Sep  6, 2021","Tormented Souls is a good first step for Dual Effect in the world of survival horror: their tribute to the 90s is clear without falling into plagiarism, the puzzles are well thought out, but the game needs a few more touches to make the experience less rigid."
2909,158,Tormented Souls,70,Wccftech,"Sep 26, 2021","Tormented Souls is a love letter and throwback to the old school survival horror games, warts and all, even including the age-old tank controls found in the games it looks to emulate. Honestly, it does a good job in this, setting the atmosphere, ramping up the stakes and only rarely venturing into the absurd when it comes to puzzle logic. While not completely innocent, with some nonsense puzzles, and a questionable art style for the protagonist, there's enough on offer to keep you going and it makes it more than worth the reasonable price of the game."
2910,158,Tormented Souls,70,GameOver.gr,"Sep 10, 2021","Tormented Souls definitely has some issues, mainly the highly derivative combat system and map. Nevertheless, when it comes to level design, highly challenging riddles, and overall dark atmosphere it’s one of the best, if not the best, indie survival horror games aiming at a nostalgic trip to the survival horror games of old."
2911,158,Tormented Souls,70,COGconnected,"Aug 31, 2021","All in all, Tormented Souls achieves what it set out to do: recapture the magic of old-school fixed-perspective survival horror games with modern technology. However, this extends to having a lackluster story and underwhelming voice-acting, both of which plagued early survival horror titles. While the game’s tension, atmosphere, and environmental storytelling are top-notch, the controls can be difficult without a controller and some decisions are downright tasteless. In the end, this game will probably appeal most to people who already love classic survival horror rather than bringing in new fans."
2912,158,Tormented Souls,70,PC Invasion,"Aug 28, 2021","Both well-designed in some spots and iffier in others, Tormented Souls can be highly frustrating, but is an overall enjoyable classic-style survival-horror experience that fans will be happy to have."
2913,158,Tormented Souls,65,Jeuxvideo.com,"Sep  3, 2021","Under its broke survival horror airs, Tormented Souls is much more solid than it looks, not least thanks to its very controlled production and atmosphere. It is with great pleasure that we walk through the corridors of a very mysterious manor, until we find ourselves faced with puzzlingly difficult puzzles, further weighed down by a map that is sorely lacking in information. The thrill of discovery then turns into a frustrating stroll, especially during a second part which requires going through most of the rooms already visited. Other flaws (animations, inventory) add to the overall weight even more, without overwhelming it. So we end up with a nice tribute to Resident Evil and Silent Hill of the time, but not especially in the face of an unmissable survival horror. To try anyway."
2914,158,Tormented Souls,56,Game World Navigator Magazine,"Nov 30, 2021","Resident Evil 2 Remake shows how to properly blend old-school horror ideas with modern action to create a great game.

I've been enjoying messing around with it with my friends and will definitely keep delving into Job Job, Drawful Animate, and Weapons Drawn. On the other hand, I find the trivia games to be a bit dull, and I think The Poll Mine has a short shelf life, at least when it comes down to how I like to play games."
2927,160,The Jackbox Party Pack 8,80,Siliconera,"Oct 14, 2021","This game is honestly all over the place. There’s a naming of an accomplice that is tough for others to guess. There’s a voting about which art to investigate. (And then you loop around and do more of them anyway?) It never feels like Weapons Drawn knows entirely what it wants to be. Still, there’s some fun in trying to spot letters. The second round keeps the same letter for your art, but uses different writing styles to make it truly tough. We appreciate the ambition, but this one’s tough to get your mind around most of the time."

2929,160,The Jackbox Party Pack 8,70,TheGamer,"Oct 13, 2021","Jackbox Party Pack 8 is a great entry in the Jackbox series, propped up by Job Job and Drawful Animate. The Wheel of Enormous Proportions is one of the better trivia games when it’s not trying to be funny, and less punishing than Trivia Murder Mystery Party. The Poll Mine and Weapons Drawn are both new ideas for the series, but only Weapons Drawn really lands, and even then if you have the collective works of Jackbox, I don't think it'll come up in the rotation much. It's a solid Jackbox Pack with two great-if-not-quite-legendary games, one good trivia game, and two more experimental titles that your mileage may vary on. It's not Jackbox 3, but hey, it's also not Jackbox 6."

From the trivia of The Wheel of Enormous Proportions and the Pictionary-style fun of Drawful Animate to the chilling murder mystery of Weapons Drawn, this quirky minigame collection could make for a nice source of entertainment at the next family gathering or holiday party."

This is one yearly release I’m happy to support because Jackbox offers crazy good value for money and a gaming environment that’s so approachable for gamers and non-gamers alike. After 8 years of annual releases, The Jackbox Party Pack 8 certainly doesn’t feel as special as past games, but the entertainment found within is undeniable."
2932,161,Evil Genius 2: World Domination,100,TheGamer,"Mar 29, 2021","The balance of needing to manage your lair and check your world map is particularly well done. As your network grows it can get harder to avoid lockdowns, but upgrades bring it back in line. My only minor gripe is that you can’t properly micromanage minions. They have auto-assigned tasks and if you need things prioritizing - for instance, the removal of dead agents blocking the corridor - you need to get your Genius to step in, which can be dangerous. If you love building games, creating elaborate strings of traps, playing the bad guy, and generally living your best island life scamming tourists, Evil Genius 2 is for you."

Ultimately, Evil Genius 2 is a Dungeon Keeper clone in a different coat of paint. The surface has been well-prepped and the paint was applied with great expertise, though. If you consider yourself a fan of simulation-strategy games, this has to go on your must-play list for 2021."

Beyond that, influencing minions is easier, it streamlines tasks, you have more control over minion capacity, there’s a fast-forward option to reduce empty time, and the crime lords themselves have much more personality, helped in no small part by the star-studded voice cast. The only drawback is on the World Stage. Quests usually involve dispatching different minion combinations, and while it does affect how you balance your lair, the lack of variety means non-story quests feel stale fairly quickly. It’s easy to overlook, though. With its fantastic ‘60s art style, swanky soundtrack, and compelling, in-depth management, Evil Genius 2 is one of the best strategy simulators around."

It doesn't break the mold but focuses on streamlining the core gameplay while adding more enemies, features and traps. It's similar enough that it probably won't change your mind if you didn't like the original, but by the same token, if you liked Evil Genius, you'll most likely enjoy Evil Genius 2. It's also a good starting point, as you don't need knowledge of the original to jump into evil scheming. It's not perfect, but it's probably the best supervillain simulator out there."

2970,161,Evil Genius 2: World Domination,72,Game Over Online,"Apr 13, 2021","Overall, I have mixed feelings about Evil Genius 2. It does a nice enough job of modernizing the original game, and it has far more replay value than the original game had (with four evil geniuses and three islands to choose from, where each choice changes the way you play the game). But the 60+ hour campaign is a slow slog, and it wears out its welcome so thoroughly that you might not even care about replay value by the time you finally grind your way through it. I could see Evil Genius 2 getting better after patching and DLC, but it’s tough to see how Revolution can possibly fix the campaign. And so Evil Genius 2 is a coin flip for me. Get it if you loved the original game, or if base-building / tower defense games are your cup of tea. Wait for patches and a sale otherwise."

As a chance to stomp around in an underground base built into a volcano, shouting at people and firing giant superlasers at Australia just for the sheer fun of it, it's pretty much your best option."

However, there’s still some rough edges here, and some game balancing that could have made it even more engaging, both for those who adore resource management and those who might just like the challenge of taking over the world with the help of a few shiny new doomsday devices."

Though its management gameplay creates momentary frustrations, the tight rapport among all the different elements of the Genius' organization make for a challenging, long-term management puzzle that requires you to both move quickly and take your time. Plus, you can use a giant magnet to drag your enemies into a flamethrower, which is pretty damn whimsical. You know, in an evil way."

The original game also suffered from an intense lack of player control and management tools back in 2004, and Rebellion somehow missed all of that when designing its sequel. As fitting and poetic it is for evil to defeat itself through incompetence, it makes for truly terrible gameplay when a player fails at a game because he is not given the tools to succeed when the game misbehaves. It ruins what is otherwise a great and very well produced title, and the hurdles are too big to ignore -- Rebellion managed to make the concept of launching international schemes to rule the world a boring endeavour."

It feels like something you might have found on your dad or friend’s computer back in the Windows 3.1 era and sunk a few diverting hours into. Unfortunately, a lack of depth, challenge, and modern features makes the game hard to fully recommend in 2021.

The Medium is a terrifying and disturbing look into the darkest recesses of human behavior, wrapped in an immersive, atmospheric, and beautiful looking game world."
2990,162,The Medium,92,PC Gamer,"Jan 27, 2021",A third-person horror game that's elevated by some of the sharpest writing and acting in the genre.
2991,162,The Medium,91,Player 2,"Jan 27, 2021","The Medium is an atmospherically creepy psychological thriller that puts a new spin on the genre while evoking feelings that fans of Silent Hill will find familiar. If you’ve been looking for a tense horror game that’s largely without jump scares but will still leave you with chills, this one’s for you."
2992,162,The Medium,90,DarkStation,"Feb  8, 2021",The Medium may lack the sparkle and glam of big games because of its introverted and personal nature but that’s the very reason its take on mental issues holds up so exceptionally well.
2993,162,The Medium,90,GameCritics,"Feb  1, 2021","Overall, The Medium is a fantastic experience. It’s a troubling, emotional, and wrenching nightmare packed into a compact running time, and while its ending may be a little too ambiguous for some, I’m happy to say that The Medium offers a dark mystery that is absolutely worth solving."
2994,162,The Medium,90,Vgames,"Jan 31, 2021","The Medium is an ambitious game, for a studio like Bloober Team, this would probably have been too big of a challenge to take on a few years ago. The studio took a different approach to their horror games and focused on the narrative and interesting mechanics to make for an amazing game."
2995,162,The Medium,90,Game Over Online,"Jan 29, 2021","If you’re a fan of older adventure games, like Syberia or Still Life, The Medium was made almost specifically for you. If you’re an old-school survival horror fan who doesn’t think the genre’s done better than Silent Hill 2 in 20 years, The Medium is very much in your wheelhouse. If you’re not in either of those categories, I’m not sure if you’d get past the first 20 minutes. For me, it’s a 90%, because I’ll be thinking about this one for a while, but I can’t give it more than an extremely qualified recommendation."
2996,162,The Medium,90,GameSpace,"Jan 27, 2021","With a fairly direct narrative, this might not be the sort of game that you’ll head back to replay often but this is an experience worth picking up. Bloober Team’s latest story manages to be both unsettling and engaging in equal measure. The presentation is fantastic, the characterization and voice acting is great, and the nods to other horror tropes is knowing rather than sloppy. This team from Krakow clearly know their chosen genre inside out and while it might be hard to fully discuss this new horror title without ruining the twists in the tale, I can be certain that The Medium will make you think twice about your next vacation."
2997,162,The Medium,90,GRYOnline.pl,"Jan 27, 2021","The Medium is not only the best game from the Bloober Team but also one of the greatest virtual psychological horrors out there. It's on the same level as the masterpiece I consider What Remains of Edith Finch to be. And if you accept the lack of survival and action elements in the gameplay, you'll get a great heir to the Silent Hill series. If you prefer story and atmosphere over typical action - it's a game for you."
2998,162,The Medium,90,The Digital Fix,"Jan 27, 2021","While The Medium does not look truly next-gen, the excellent dual-reality mechanics and storytelling prowess of Bloober Team ensure it is one of the most technically and narratively sophisticated horror games to come out in years, recalling the best of games like Silent Hill."
2999,162,The Medium,90,GameSpot,"Jan 27, 2021","Eventually The Medium's narrative threads begin to weave together, even connecting to the original goal of discovering Marianne's origins. The promise that everything somehow connects in some unforeseen and fascinating way is a thrilling reason to see the game all the way through. The connections to real-world events of Polish history make many of the revelations even more poignant--even if the supernatural aspects are fictional, it's deeply unsettling to think about how some of the evil present in this game did actually occur. And to that end, The Medium's conclusion sticks with you; it's one last horrifying reminder that trauma may not define a person, but it can have consequences we can't even begin to foresee if it's not adequately dealt with and simply left to fester over time. I can't say I enjoyed the ending to The Medium, but I am deeply satisfied with how it sets up the inescapable nature of its horrifying conclusion."
3000,162,The Medium,90,Multiplayer.it,"Jan 27, 2021","So far, The Medium is the best game developed by Bloober Team: a love letter to the horror genre and a major step forward for the studio."
3001,162,The Medium,88,The Games Machine,"Jan 27, 2021","The latest horror from Bloober Team is a great bridge between the new generation of consoles and the old classics of the genre, with an intriguing story, a surreal setting and a road full of puzzles to decipher."
3002,162,The Medium,85,Gamersky,"Jan 29, 2021","The Medium is one of the best quality horror games in recent years. This game learns many essences of ""Silent Hill"", and tells a suspenseful story with its own pace."
3003,162,The Medium,85,GameGrin,"Jan 28, 2021",A deeply thought-provoking and mature psychological horror game that honours its influences without relying entirely on nostalgia.
3004,162,The Medium,85,GameWatcher,"Jan 27, 2021","Despite its linearity, I'd argue that The Medium is a genuinely chilling ghost story that's sure to leave a lasting impression. The splitscreen effects make for quite a few memorable moments, and there's no denying the growing sense of accomplishment as you solve difficult puzzles and make your way through the cursed resort. It may not be on the same level as some of its inspirations, but I'd definitely recommend The Medium to any fan of classic survival horror."
3005,162,The Medium,85,Critical Hit,"Jan 27, 2021","Literally straddling the line between supernatural and real-world horror, The Medium is satisfying, sleek, and sophisticated in every department. While it makes only limited use of its signature simultaneous reality mechanic, and features some of the same gameplay frustrations as earlier Bloober Team games, it’s easy to overlook such stumbles. The Medium sidesteps scare gimmicks to deliver a masterclass in mature horror, one rooted in atmosphere, all-round restraint, and an enthralling region-specific story."
3006,162,The Medium,84,GameStar,"Jan 27, 2021","I couldn't do anything with previous works that were quite jumpscare-heavy with Bloober Teams, but The Medium grabbed me straight away."
3007,162,The Medium,80,Cubed3,"Feb 25, 2021","The Medium isn't an unflawed masterpiece. It's got some performance issues on PC and some jankeyness in unexpected places. However it has got this absolutely unique horror atmosphere, beautifully crafted worlds and some absolute heart-string pulling story moments. This is a successful return of the ""horror adventure"" game style from those golden oldies everyone fondly remembers. Bloober Team has done an outstanding job making this title and it's one hundred percent recommended to all fans of horror."
3008,162,The Medium,80,Worth Playing,"Jan 28, 2021","Like many of Bloober Team's titles, The Medium isn't a horror game made for all horror fans. The lack of jump-scares can be refreshing, but some will be turned off by the lack of combat and danger. The game's relaxed pace, its linear nature, and the ease of its puzzles can erode the tension of the mystery. The strong atmosphere, grounded characters, and solid storyline will attract horror fans who are looking for something other than grotesque monsters to hunt down or run away from. For those who value plot over punch, The Medium is a journey worth taking."
3009,162,The Medium,80,MGG,"Jan 27, 2021","With The Medium, Bloober Team delivers a sordid story — though not always easy to pin down. Despite the sometimes ludicrous character animation, blurring effects not necessarily justified, and the presence of a few artifacts, the graphics are high quality and often well-inspired. The chases and the passages in the characters' psyche are quite memorable. If you don't mind games which are linear and focus on the narrative more than the action, you'll have a great time with The Medium — and its amazing OST."
3010,162,The Medium,80,GameMAG,"Jan 27, 2021","The Medium is full of deep and intertwined narrative, moreso than many other games from recent years. If you love The Longest Journey, Silent Hill and The Evil Within for the overall atmosphere and tone, but also prefer something less action-oriented, then The Medium is something you don't want to miss."
3011,162,The Medium,80,TheSixthAxis,"Jan 27, 2021","The Medium is a really good horror adventure with some stand out ideas and excellent presentation. It makes the most of its influences to create an atmospheric and involving narrative, but its wider context as a next-gen exclusive may lead many to expect it to be a grander step forward than it is. Taken on its own merits, and particularly for genre fans, this is a genuinely great game and I look forward to replaying it to take in all the amazing details and touches that I may have missed first time through. With some questions left unanswered, I hope it does well and develops into a franchise."
3012,162,The Medium,80,SpazioGames,"Jan 27, 2021","The Medium is a step forward for Bloober Team, mature enough to propose a compelling, twisted dark thriller with an astonishing visual art. Without run&hide sessions and with a more complex level design. it could be a more enjoyable game."
3013,162,The Medium,80,Hardcore Gamer,"Jan 27, 2021","One could argue that outside of its creative double-world approach, The Medium isn’t the sort of revolutionary horror game that one might hope for from the start of a new generation in gaming. But you know what? It doesn’t need to be revolutionary. It just needs to be spooky, have fun gameplay and tell an entertaining story, and Bloober Team succeeds on all of those fronts."
3014,162,The Medium,80,Hey Poor Player,"Jan 27, 2021","I think I've hit my legal limit on flowery language in this review already, so I'll keep it plain and simple in the end; The Medium is a fun, unsettling atmospheric horror game that is guaranteed to knock your socks off if you even remotely appreciate artistic design. It's not a ""traditional horror game,"" but, then again, none of the Bloober Team games I've ever played have been traditional horror games. If you have a day to spare and want to spend it with a game guaranteed to draw you in (even if it takes a few hours to do so), then I don't think you'll regret taking The Medium out for a spin."
3015,162,The Medium,80,Eurogamer Italy,"Jan 27, 2021","The Medium is yet additional proof of Bloober Team's talent in creating authentic digital nightmares. Gameplay-wise the game is inspired by the classics of the past without giving up its own personal imprint, and the story is also well written. The art direction, though, is the real deal."
3016,162,The Medium,75,GameCrate,"Jan 28, 2021","The Medium is at its best when you are exploring its remarkable, beautiful worlds, or enjoying the excellent composition and art direction. Unfortunately, the gameplay does not meet that high mark, and often detracts from what is otherwise a stellar aesthetic experience."
3017,162,The Medium,75,PC Invasion,"Jan 27, 2021","Although it has demanding system requirements, The Medium is still a marvelous offering when it comes to its visuals and gameplay. Its locations will haunt and horrify you, and its dual-reality system will provide refreshing ways to complete your objectives. Unfortunately, it also suffers from a few technical hiccups, and its bizarrely abrupt conclusion leaves a lot to be desired."
3018,162,The Medium,70,DarkZero,"Feb  9, 2021","The Medium is an interesting title to play through, but I think it is fair to say that while the split-screen, dual world element is a fascinating idea, it never truly excels at pushing the idea to its maximum potential. There are teases of what could be done here, but this is no new revolutionary way to play. Taking The Medium as an horror game, it brings a brilliant soundtrack that gives life to its locations with eerie atmosphere, an engrossing story that I wanted to see until its conclusion; the main element people will remember once the dust has settled in. Expect The Medium to be a mixture of uncomplicated investigatory item solving and walking through its striking environment art, a captivating and well presented world that is visually pleasing (or disgusting depending how you look at it), but one world where the scares are scripted to certain parts of the story, which stop any potential for this game to have a truly frightening experience."
3019,162,The Medium,70,Gamers' Temple,"Feb  3, 2021","The Medium is a decent psychological horror from the start, but it’s rather hollow when it comes to gameplay."
3020,162,The Medium,70,Merlin'in Kazanı (Turkey),"Jan 27, 2021","If you like the horror, thriller genre, I can say that The Medium is a game where you can get a nostalgic taste."
3021,162,The Medium,70,Jeuxvideo.com,"Jan 27, 2021","The Bloober Team delivers a psychological and supernatural thriller with multiple controlled influences, and a story that is both dark and touching. The Medium is an artistic work in its own right, both visual and musical, whose universe deserves to be explored. The Polish studio also manage to take advantage of this playful duality between the physical and spiritual planes without necessarily innovating too much during a linear adventure. The threat weighing on Marianne, as intense as it may be at times, loses too often in intensity to permanently mark the players. The Medium is ultimately an “arty” horrific experience like the developers' previous productions."
3022,162,The Medium,69,Riot Pixels,"Apr  1, 2021","The Medium deftly ties all loose story ends and shows impressive art direction, but it lacks wholeness. The game feels like an artist who has too many ideas at the same time; he would grab a brush, then a pen or a piece of coal… but still cannot finish his masterpiece."
3023,162,The Medium,68,Game Informer,"Jan 27, 2021","Some of the best horror games of the last decade have offered combat-free frights. After all, abandoned buildings are scarier when you can’t push back against the shadows. However, The Medium’s lack of combat highlights the challenge of letting atmosphere and puzzles carry a horror experience. The idea of exploring split realities is neat, but Bloober Team needed another gameplay hook to hang its hat on, because this horror show is a bit shallow."
3024,162,The Medium,65,App Trigger,"Feb  2, 2021","If you go into The Medium with very high hopes, you will be disappointed, but if you walk in just looking for some eerie atmospheres, some award-winning voice acting and some nostalgic horror feels, then you will have some fun."
3025,162,The Medium,65,Malditos Nerds,"Jan 27, 2021",You can tell that Bloober Team loves horror and The Medium has a lot of lovable details. The atmosphere and original mechanics are the strong point. But the story loses strength and even becomes confusing. This added to the excessive linearity and the chases obtuse design don't allow me to recommend it more than to true fans of the genre.
3026,162,The Medium,62,New Game Network,"Feb  2, 2021","The Medium is a flawed horror experience with an interesting story and a visually captivating spirit world. Fixed camera angles add excess clumsiness and the terrible framerate drops make it difficult to enjoy the split-screen views.

3027,162,The Medium,60,LEVEL (Czech Republic),"Apr 12, 2021","The Medium is a psychological thriller with various simple puzzles, a whiff of horror and music like from Silent Hill. As a result, you will play the game mainly because of the storytelling and for its atmosphere. [Issue#310]"
3028,162,The Medium,60,Adventure Gamers,"Feb 10, 2021","The Medium creates a nightmarish limbo for untethered souls in which players must evade, outwit and even aid its horrific inhabitants, but the strong atmosphere and effective scares aren’t enough to completely atone for a poorly constructed story and one-dimensional protagonist."
3029,162,The Medium,60,PCMag,"Feb  3, 2021","The Medium impresses with its next-gen graphics and unique, split-screenplay that lets you jump between the human and spirit worlds. Unfortunately, the horror game's not particularly scary."
3030,162,The Medium,60,The Indie Game Website,"Jan 27, 2021","As a horror game, The Medium doesn’t have enough resistance or solid scares overall, and as a tone piece, it often misses the mark with a lack of maturity and care in scripting. The core conceit of the game rears its head unexpectedly as it fails to reconcile its deep themes with its desire for shock, and its desire to create a horror experience without any strong mechanical grounding. The game doesn’t really provide anything to bridge its evocative artwork to its less than accomplished themes...For those that want to explore a fascinating looking interpretation of a spiritual world, however, The Medium is a rambling holiday in a wonderful macabre charnel house, but if you want something a little more bracing, you might want to look elsewhere."
3031,162,The Medium,60,Areajugones,"Jan 27, 2021","The Medium is a game with neither big flaws nor anything it really excels at. The gameplay is quite simple and the story kind of reaches a mid point in between a horror book and a socio-political discourse that do not really match. In the end, it all amounts to a mediocre game by Bloober Team that, most likely, will have been forgotten by the end of the year."
3032,162,The Medium,60,PCGamesN,"Jan 27, 2021","Bloober Team does well to keep things taut all the way to the end, but there's a frustrating amount of untapped potential beneath its gameplay gimmicks and art direction."
3033,162,The Medium,60,Shacknews,"Jan 27, 2021","Despite some missteps, there is good in The Medium. If you want a decent horror story to wade through, which offers telltale signs of the classics we’ve come to know and love, then Bloober Team’s latest is just that."
3034,162,The Medium,60,Destructoid,"Jan 27, 2021","My favorite part of The Medium ended up being its ""semi-fixed cameras,"" which blend old and new design philosophies in a way that seems genuinely palatable in 2021."
3035,162,The Medium,50,PC Games,"Jan 28, 2021",I really wanted to like The Medium. It tells a grown-up tale fitting for the genre and features strong location design and sound design.

3036,162,The Medium,50,GamesRadar+,"Jan 27, 2021","The Medium isn't even really a horror game, despite the setting and themes, and lacks any scares bar an early cheap jump.

3041,163,The Elder Scrolls Online: Blackwood,85,GamingTrend,"Jul  2, 2021","I am a huge fan of the entire Elder Scrolls franchise, and have played ESO since beta. My absolute favorite Chapter was Elsweyr and that will forever be a hard one to top, but Blackwood was quite enjoyable. The addition of Companions is fun for both new and veteran players, but I am kind of left feeling like this could have been a DLC rather than a full-blown Chapter. I had a good time questing through the area and completing the main story, and the throwbacks to Oblivion with the story and portals were very cool. I definitely hope to see more Companions added to the game, even if it’s through the Crown Store. My only request is to add on to the already amazing story that is being told!"
3042,163,The Elder Scrolls Online: Blackwood,83,Gaming Age,"Jul 16, 2021","While Blackwood might not shake up the game, or make any huge changes to the core of what Elder Scrolls Online has become, it stands as another solid chapter to an already incredibly expansive game. ESO is my favorite MMORPG, and I come from a place of genuine love for the game when I say that I hope for something *more* in future chapters. I want ESO to continue to grow and draw in new players while retaining veterans, for another decade to come."

Elder Scrolls Onlinehas a pretty decent formula and Blackwood is a decent extent of the core game. Companions are the best supplement for the game, that reminds me of Bioware's golden era. The random portals that force exploration and drive you sideways are solid. I wish the quest line would be less predictable and the fights would be harder to beat. But all in all this is a great DLC to own."
3044,163,The Elder Scrolls Online: Blackwood,80,Game Rant,"Jun 21, 2021","In the end, The Elder Scrolls Online: Blackwood provides enough intrigue and content to whet one's appetite for new experiences, but won't be enough to fully satiate every player. Thwarting the Daedric machinations of Mehrunes Dagon and the Order of the Waking Flame is a fun experience, even if the current story didn't have a satisfying conclusion. It is absolutely clear that the developers put immense effort into the creation of Blackwood, from its sound and level designs to some of its more haunting and hellish landscapes."
3045,163,The Elder Scrolls Online: Blackwood,80,The Games Machine,"Jun 15, 2021","The Elder Scrolls Online: Blackwood feels like an expansion developed with a different degree of maturity. Rather than adding new classes or skill lines, it focuses on improving the new player experience, while also adding intriguing new story content and world events. The addition of AI companions also makes the solo experience much more appealing, although obviously you’ll still have to look for flesh-and-bone teammates if you want to tackle tougher trials and events. Overall, a solid expansion pack, although we wish we could have had a better look at the Seal of Endeavors system."

The setting is tighter and more focused than last time, and the performance at launch harkens back to prior launches during the Before Times. The Elder Scrolls Online: Blackwood is a good addition to the MMO’s expansion roster, and one that’ll be a definite draw for those who remember walking the streets of Cyrodiil fondly once upon a time."
3048,163,The Elder Scrolls Online: Blackwood,70,XGN,"Jul 12, 2021","The Elder Scrolls Online: Blackwood offers a lot of new content, just like previous chapters for the popular MMO. The storyline and new region does feel a bit less special than heavy-hitters like Elsweyr and Summerset and the expansion doesn't offer any new classes and skill lines. It's not a bad chapter, but it's by far the weakest expansion for ESO so far."
3049,163,The Elder Scrolls Online: Blackwood,70,Hooked Gamers,"Jun 24, 2021","If it has been a while since you have visited Tamriel, then Blackwood is definitely a great place to jump back into The Elder Scrolls Online. There will be a familiarity to the game, as the new features of Companions and Oblivion Portal do not add too much to the game. Whereby the Greymoor expansion added Antiquities, Blackwood simply offers a friend to journey by your side. But in saying that, these companions are a welcome addition to the online RPG – allowing those singleplayer types to enjoy a pseudo multiplayer experience."

3051,163,The Elder Scrolls Online: Blackwood,70,TheSixthAxis,"Jun 15, 2021","Blackwood is a brilliant throwback to Oblivion, but it feels like a starting point for a grander tale. Players going into Blackwood expecting a full-fat expansion experience will feel slightly letdown. Its dedication to 2006s Cyrodill shines through with the spaced out content making the overall zone feel a little empty. Still, the content itself is a job well done, ticking all the boxes to keep players entertained, but new features like Blackwood's companions work best when revisiting older zones."
3052,163,The Elder Scrolls Online: Blackwood,70,IGN,"Jun 11, 2021","The Elder Scrolls Online: Blackwood delivers more of the same – albeit this new helping is a step up from last year’s Greymoor expansion in its often funny writing and striking map layout. Blackwood leans hard on its nostalgia, but it actually manages to feel like an appropriate prequel to Oblivion without forcing you down too many of the same paths. Its companion system is definitely worth checking out, too, but it may not be enough gameplay variety to recommit a fan who is tired of ESO in general. For those of us who are still happily jogging along on the treadmill, though, there’s plenty to do and see here, if for no other reason than to simply fortify your understanding of Elder Scrolls lore."
3053,163,The Elder Scrolls Online: Blackwood,70,Jeuxvideo.com,"Jun 10, 2021","Over the course of its expansions, The Elder Scrolls Online continues to deliver what is expected of it ... or almost. With Blackwood, the content available is certainly interesting, especially when you are a fan of Oblivion, but you should not expect more. By choosing to direct it towards new players, Zenimax Online is probably forgetting its hard core a little on the side of a road that is too monotonous. The observation made in 2019 as in 2020 is therefore the same here, and what could be understandable at the time is much less so in 2021 when the competition sometimes competes with ingenuity to surprise us. A first warning shot that must however be weighed in view of the work carried out on the lore, which is still as fascinating as ever."
3054,163,The Elder Scrolls Online: Blackwood,60,Screen Rant,"Jul  6, 2021","Elder Scrolls Online: Blackwood is a solid expansion to ZeniMax's popular MMORPG, explaining the rise of Mehrunes Dagon and introducing new mechanics that can be expanded upon in future chapters. Fans of Elder Scrolls Online are likely to find something they really enjoy about the Blackwood zone and story despite some of the drawbacks, and new and solo players can have a much better experience diving in and facing challenges if they start with Blackwood, thanks to the new features."
3055,163,The Elder Scrolls Online: Blackwood,60,Gfinity,"Jun  8, 2021","ESO Blackwood feels and plays more like an interim update than a significant new expansion. That could change with new additions over the next year, but I think it’s time for ZeniMax to step back and take longer than a year to create these new expansions. Fan service is fine, but it should be anchored to something more solid and substantial as well to make it worthwhile. Until that happens, just wait for a sale."
3056,163,The Elder Scrolls Online: Blackwood,60,Checkpoint Gaming,"Jun  6, 2021","ESO: Blackwood is familiar territory for fans of the universe. While it provides heaps of armour sets to collect, enemies to defeat, and captivating characters to meet, it won’t be anyone’s favourite. This chapter of the MMO lacks an unseen and astounding setting, like Elsywere and Summerset had before it. The chapter relies on nostalgia, where that hole was filled with the previous Greymoor chapter. Lacking player versus player content, a memorable main story, and environments, Blackwood just isn’t up to scratch. However, as a complete package, The Elder Scrolls Online continues to be one of the best quality MMO experiences."

However, no matter the issues, the gameplay is engaging, exciting and most of all, fun.

In that, this remake is rather successful, especially as the formula is generally still effective. On the other hand, we must admit that certain elements show the weight of the years and in particular AI. The new interface is also not very intuitive and the graphics remain below those of Total War: Rome 2.

A new lick of paint and some quality of life improvements aren't enough to make this remaster an appealing option for newcomers when better Total War games already exist. That's not to say it doesn't deserve its place either. At this point, Rome: Total War is unaccommodating on modern hardware, so this remaster solves that issue with an improved and updated version of the original game.

You have freedom in the directions you want to go with crafting and leveling up, and the narrative choices you make feel meaningful. The game keeps you constantly engaged, as it always feels like there’s an important mission to complete or something to take care of around the base. The mystery is fascinating all the way to the end, and the main narrative doesn’t overstay its welcome, feeling spot on at a tight 20-ish hours. If you’ve ever wanted to tour the Chernobyl area but were afraid of the radiation, here’s your ticket to some of the sites, with some monsters tossed in to keep things lively (or deadly).

3111,165,Chernobylite,75,Hooked Gamers,"Jul 29, 2021","Chernobylite does a masterful job of drawing you in with its story, characters, and core gameplay loop. It’s well worth checking out, even at full price."

3114,165,Chernobylite,75,PC Invasion,"Jul 27, 2021","With a combination of multiple features and mechanics from different genres, as well as a setting that's steeped in mystery, Chernobylite attempts to be the jack-of-all-trades.

If we regret a fairly limited amount of different environments, a confused combat part and an AI clearly not up to the task, this melancholy escapade in the heart of the exclusion zone is a good surprise, quite targeted concerning the public that it is aimed (FPS aficionados from the East, you are welcome), but oh so immersive and intriguing."
3119,165,Chernobylite,70,COGconnected,"Jul 29, 2021","Chernobylite certainly has ambitions beyond being a rote shooter and although not everything meshes and the gears of its systems sometimes grind, the setting feels authentically haunted and foreboding. There’s a lot going on in Chernobylite, and sometimes the melancholic love story at the center gets buried under unnecessary game play complications, tepid combat or shifts of tone. In other words, it’s all still a bit messy but interesting and worth playing for shooter, RPG or horror fans, especially those fascinated by this particular moment in modern history."

If you’re willing to be patient and survival-minded, you’ll find a lot to enjoy here in Chernobylite."

For players looking for much more than just the gameplay, however, they may be left wanting."
3124,165,Chernobylite,65,GameGrin,"Aug 12, 2021","Chernobylite is a frustrating game. It’s far from unenjoyable, but there was so much potential here for something greater. At its core, it’s a fantastic recreation of Chernobyl that’s inundated with mechanics that aren’t required to enjoy this game. The Farm 51 nail atmosphere and the world, yet never seemed satisfied with what they actually wanted the game to be. It doesn’t ruin the overall experience for Chernobylite, which manages to hit the goalpost of greatness before rebounding into the net of mediocrity."

3127,165,Chernobylite,60,RPGamer,"Jul 29, 2021","It’s difficult to say if Chernobylite is worth someone’s time or not. At about twenty hours, the game never overstays its welcome and none of its composite elements are major detractors. There’s a pleasing amount of fun to be had executing the heist at the end and in interacting with the cast. However, it is a game that sets out to do a lot of little things, none of them deep or meaningful. As an RPG it’s a fairly light endeavor, but the workmanlike quality and some cool decisions will do enough to keep plenty interested throughout its whole runtime."
3128,165,Chernobylite,60,PC Games,"Jul 28, 2021","For me, Chernobylite has one problem above all: it wants too much at once. Shooting, crafting, developing skills, managing the base and team - because of all the Gampelay features, the makers have somehow lost track of everything. In the end, the genre mix seems a bit half-cooked. It's a shame."
3129,165,Chernobylite,60,IGN Italia,"Jul 28, 2021","A game with some interesting ideas and concepts, that sometimes manage to provide meaningful content to the players but are too often obscure by the deeply repetitive nature of gameplay and quest design."
3130,165,Chernobylite,60,NME,"Jul 27, 2021","It’s easy to recommend Chernobylite to Stalker fans – The Exclusion Zone has never looked better, and an ambitious choice-lead approach to storytelling means that your decisions always have very tangible consequences. Despite this, a repetitive formula and shortcomings with the base building system prevent Chernobylite from taking that last great step to irradiated greatness."
3131,165,Chernobylite,60,Checkpoint Gaming,"Jul 27, 2021","Have you ever played a game that has so many intriguing ideas that are begging to work but never quite reach that level? Chernobylite is that game for me. Never boring but never keeping me on the edge of my seat. Most of my investment here lies in the potential it shares. Donning your gear and risking your life for precious rarities may very well be worth it if you’re part of the hardcore survival fanbase and waiting on something new. If not, bunkering down and steering clear could undoubtedly do you good."
3132,165,Chernobylite,60,GameSkinny,"Jul 27, 2021","Despite the flaws, something about Chernobylite feels like it's primed to enjoy cult classic status. Troubled but daring games are often the subject of smaller but passionate fanbases, and Chernobylite is nothing is not daring. Several of those gambles don't payout in the end, but the journey is always a weird one, even if not always an exciting one."
3133,166,In Sound Mind,100,Gamer Escape,"Sep 30, 2021","Above all else, In Sound Mind is fun. The horror and melancholy of what’s going on in the plot is balanced out by light-hearted camp, the levels are all interwoven exploration puzzles where a new tool invariably makes you realize several new areas you can discover, it’s all so easy to just get lost for hours and hours until next thing you know it’s 3AM."

While the final revelations didn't blow me away, they did bring a wry smile to my face. In Sound Mind is one of my favourite indie horror games of the past few years and is highly recommended if you’re a fan of the genre."
3138,166,In Sound Mind,80,Screen Rant,"Sep 27, 2021","The true success of In Sound Mind comes from the atmosphere that We Create Stuff has crafted. The puzzles are smart and well-thought-out, the jump scares that the game utilizes don't feel forced or cheesy, and the drastically different style of each tape shines through to create a spooky, complete-feeling game."
3139,166,In Sound Mind,75,Easy Allies,"Oct  1, 2021","In Sound Mind definitely has some limitations in terms of its presentation and combat, but these elements don’t take too much away from what it does well. It’s more of a spooky mystery than a full horror title, and with its hub world, clever secrets, and evolving set of tools, it continually presents new opportunities to interact with its twisted environments. If you like games that try to screw with your head, it’s worth booking a session with Dr. Wales."
3140,166,In Sound Mind,75,The Indie Game Website,"Sep 30, 2021","It’s a bit disappointing to see that In Sound Mind doesn’t quite transcend outdated horror tropes, even though it has the potential to. But that doesn’t take away from the accomplishments that make it more intriguing than many contemporary titles: its thought-provoking puzzles, and its attempts to tell an engaging story without unnecessarily scaring you to death first."
3141,166,In Sound Mind,75,The Games Machine,"Sep 28, 2021","In Sound Mind is a well-done psychological horror, fun and stimulating from start to finish. It’s less scary than expected and could be improved from a technical standpoint, but the mix of gameplay elements knows how to stimulate the player by offering them a new element to use in each level."
3142,166,In Sound Mind,75,Noisy Pixel,"Sep 28, 2021","In Sound Mind excels at its atmosphere and characterization of Desmond and the delusions of his patients. Combat can feel a little lackluster, and the story structure is formulaic. However, there is a love of horror on display found in the environments and core design of the experience."
3143,166,In Sound Mind,75,Wccftech,"Sep 27, 2021","In Sound Mind is a surprisingly compelling title, offering an interesting story and strong horror experience. However, some aspects start to outlive their welcome - if only due to annoyance. Tackling a sensitive subject like mental health, In Sound Mind could have really fallen flat if We Create Stuff didn't handle it well, and while it can come across as heavy-handed at times, this is generally well done and worth experiencing."
3144,166,In Sound Mind,70,Jeuxvideo.com,"Oct 20, 2021","In short, it is far from equaling the pillars from which it is inspired (Outlast, Layers of Fear, Silent Hill ...) or even from being a very good game, despite a certain potential."

3147,166,In Sound Mind,66,New Game Network,"Oct 20, 2021","In Sound Mind tells an interesting story and provides an intriguing combination of first-person exploration, puzzles and shooting, but it fails to have the impact it could’ve had due to bland visuals, mediocre combat, and the fact that it’s a horror game that isn’t very scary."
3148,166,In Sound Mind,65,SECTOR.sk,"Jan 24, 2022","In Sound Mind is an above-average indie project. It is gratifying that the fear presented in the game does not build on cheap jump scares, but systematically builds a thrilling atmosphere."

3150,166,In Sound Mind,60,PC Games,"Oct 14, 2021",In Sound Mind is a solid horror game brought down by massive problems. It never runs smoothly and the controls are imprecise.

3151,167,Black Book,88,RPG Fan,"Sep 14, 2021","Morteshka’s deal with the devil has paid off, as Black Book delivers a captivating story and engaging gameplay full of strategy and variety that should keep you busy for over 40 hours. Being in league with Satan usually comes with a great price, but players should be able to overcome any curses handed down to them. With strong character development and narrative, this wicked book is a page-turner that’s worth a read."

There are certain shortcomings in translation and lack of explanation when it comes to the game’s systems, but overall it is an incredibly enjoyable narrative-driven experience."
3155,167,Black Book,80,GameSkinny,"Aug  5, 2021","It's hard for me to put a precise score on that kind of thing. I'd be happy to recommend it to anyone with a card-game addiction, it's got a few things going for it as far as being an RPG, and if you're interested in learning about Russian mythology, Black Book is practically an educational tool. However, it's also janky, inconsistent, and not great about explaining its systems. I wouldn't say that it's exactly unpolished — I get the feeling that Black Book is exactly what it was intended to be — but it feels like the sort of game that, back in the day, would've shipped with an inch-thick manual, which you don't have."
3156,167,Black Book,77,Game World Navigator Magazine,"Oct 22, 2021","A great way to dive into the folklore of the Russian North. The setting is remarkably fresh, the story is well-written, and while the card battles are rather mediocre, the game doesn’t penalize the player for skipping them.

3159,167,Black Book,70,Games.cz,"Oct  4, 2021","This game is low budget, sure, but that doesn’t hold it back in the slightest. It’s a very good card game, especially attractive for Eastern European players due to the captivating way in which it deals with Slavic mythology."
3160,167,Black Book,70,RPGamer,"Sep  3, 2021","On the whole, Black Book is a fun adventure that does enough to stand out from the crowd. The combat and card play are different enough from its contemporaries that those looking for a more traditional entry point into deck-building can give it a shot, even if the game begins to wear out its welcome by the end of its thirty or so hours. The real reason to stick with it is the great attention to detail regarding Slavic folklore and how it weaves into the gameplay in ways that can make the player feel clever. It won’t be the flashiest game anyone plays this year, but there is a good time to be had."
3161,167,Black Book,68,Riot Pixels,"Oct 17, 2021","Black Book holds a lot of promise… not as a game, but rather an interactive guide to local myths and legends. In all other aspects it’s an exercise in mediocrity."
3162,167,Black Book,65,Multiplayer.it,"Aug  5, 2021",Black Book is an intriguing game due to its unique subject matter. The problem is that the game's pace is too slow and you risk getting bored and missing out on all the good stuff in the game.
3163,167,Black Book,60,Cubed3,"Sep 27, 2021","It's hard to rate something like Black Book. It's a mix and match of things that are generally fun and refreshingly new, but the whole thing carries with it a lack of polish and balance, which could make this dark tale of witchcraft and demonology shine much brighter. This is basically a high 6, or a low 7. A mediocre, repetitive CCG/RPG, with some neat moments that'll - barely - manage to keep you interested. If looking to experience something outside of generic medieval fantasy, though, do give it a try. Morteshka's creation is basically Slavic Pagan Mythology: The Game."
3164,168,"Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector",96,Impulsegamer,"Aug 16, 2021","To date, ‘Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector’ is the best digital rendition of the Warhammer 40k table-top miniatures game that I’ve ever played. The amazing attention to detail and unknowing nature of each mission will resonate deeply with 40k fans and be a good starting point for newcomers to the franchise. Personally, I would have loved to have seen more factions engaged in battle but introducing the Sisters of Battle as reinforcements has been a clever way to expand the list of units available without straying away from the deep lore that the game is set in. Although I wouldn’t call ‘Battlesector’ a difficult game, it does pose quite the challenge for players of all skill levels. I recommend this game to anyone who wants to get into Warhammer or is already a fan. Hopefully more units and factions will become available in the future, further adding to enormous amount replay value."

Challenging strategic battles, appropriately melodramatic voice work, more than decent graphics, and a respectful translation of the tabletop game to a digital format make this a must-have for fans of the franchise, and even appealing for casual strategy fans who are not yet invested in all things Warhammer."

The campaign escalates nicely and does a good job of selling the desperation of your mission. Being able to easily switch out your units and play around with army composition is also a really nice touch that means you don’t end up locked into a single playstyle. Campaign re-playability is somewhat lacking but the skirmish mode gives you the chance to play against friends so there is that. Considering how many new campaigns and modes were added to Deadlock over the years, we can probably expect some expansions in the future."

This, combined with beautiful visuals and an immersive story told in typical Warhammer fashion, makes for a fun strategy romp from beginning to end, no matter whether you’re a die-hard Warhammer fan or a total newcomer to the Warhammer world.

3188,169,Severed Steel,80,Softpedia,"Oct  5, 2021","Severed Steel will be a massive video game for a narrow group of gamers. If you love perfecting a plan and then spending as much time as needed to both car3efully and quickly execute it, you will love this experience. Running on a wall, diving through a window, all the time dodging enemy attacks, only to then slide and kill two enemies before finding a safe space is a fun time. But the game can also frustrate and annoy. The levels could be a little bigger and more varied. I like the restrictions on weapon use, but some players will hate it. But the development team at Greylock knows that the first-person shooter needs to evolve to be interesting and they have some good ideas about whether the genre should go. Even if you don’t love Severed Steel keep an eye out for what they work on next."

Anyone looking for a supremely easy to get into action game that blends the bullet-time from Max Payne with a bombastic soundtrack pumping techno music and all the slides and dives from 80-90’s action movies…look absolutely no further than Severed Steel. For a first game Greylock has nailed it and I can’t wait to see this gem on consoles."

3201,170,Strangeland,88,KeenGamer,"May 26, 2021","Strangeland is both a satisfying mystery and an atmospheric horror journey through a dark nightmare. Humor and tragedy collide to bring a literary experience for its players. Great puzzles, character writing, and multiple possible solutions give credit to its players while personalizing the path to one of the endings. Overall, Strangeland is a complete experience that masterfully balances grotesquerie and relatability."

Yes I would, especially to players willing to expand their boundaries and go beyond the general concept of what a videogame story is. The obscure, allegorical journey of the Stranger is not a typical adventure game for fans of the genre, but ultimately an experience that will amply reward those who come to it with an open mind. Will it prove as enduring as the great literary works? Only time will tell."

Furthermore, it’s just a little bit on the easy side (even without using the payphone), too. I also found some of the ideas in the game just a little underdeveloped, which actually manifested as my own curiosity to know more about Strangeland — certain NPCs, or rooms, for example — but the content just wasn’t there. All that said, though — keep in mind — this is only a $15 game, and at that price, it’s an excellent value."

The story itself is dense with a script layered in symbolism, but never so obtuse where the uninformed can't get by. Thematically, much of the plot centres around the self - self-acceptance, self-doubt, self-destruction, and self-actualization - along with the pursuit of identity. Puzzles lean into the hostile aesthetic to provide a fair degree of challenge, while hints are always available. It all makes for a well-paced, well realized journey that doesn't outstay its welcome. Strangeland is a short adventure, but one of the finest entries in the genre."

While boasting a decent story, it never breaks the mold of the established formula, feeling more like ""yet another kingmaker story"" rather than an adventure that lives up to the potential of the setting. It has a few new ideas and spins a few old mechanics into a new form, but at the end of the day, it plays it way too safe, which causes it to feel uninspired. If you loved Valhalla, this DLC will give you more of that, but if you're already fatigued by its repetitive gameplay, Wrath of the Druids won't change that."

Offering 10 to 15 hours of scripted adventure, it extends the experience, serving us Ireland on a set. However, we would have appreciated a more in-depth treatment of the druids, relegated to the rank of obscure threat like “Order of the Ancients” and a much better balanced difficulty, just to do honor to the various quests, both main and secondary."

However, many of the gameplay elements in this new game are awfully like the versions that were first established in Far Cry 3 and reused with minimal changes in every subsequent game. There's certainly more than enough content to validate the game as its own, full entry into the series.

Far Cry 6 is a compelling reminder that video games can be so silly and that sometimes that's exactly what they need to be in order to be effectively cathartic. Yet in spite of that silliness, the game actually isn’t shy about having something to say. Here is a game that is many, many things all at once, but it also seems to understand itself so well."

We have to admit that the scenery of the island of Yara is exotic and the story around Antón Castillo is rather interesting. However, the recipe is starting to run out of steam. The few new features are not enough to make up for a huge but cruelly empty map. As for the scenario, it quickly becomes a bit stale, with quests following one another without really managing to keep us in suspense. Nevertheless, if you want to dive into the heart of the guerrilla war with a friend, and not Chorizo, note that the game becomes much more fun with two players."

And yet dismantling Castillo’s grip on Yara doesn’t feel too far removed from going up against Hoyt Volker, Pagan Min, or Joseph Seed. If you’ve played a recent Far Cry game, you know exactly what you’re in for with 6. It’s a well-trodden formula of epic scale that has just enough life in it to keep it from being tired."
3264,173,Far Cry 6,65,GameWatcher,"Oct 13, 2021","Far Cry 6 finds the series at its most complacent and stale, showing little desire to push things forward and missing the mark when it comes to its story and villain. And yet, despite the tired recipe, there’s still an adequately enjoyable first-person shooter underneath that manages to offer the freedom expected of it and make popping the heads of countless dumb opponents feel satisfying. How much you’ll enjoy it really depends on where you’re approaching it from. As a new player, its world will keep you busy and show you a good chunk of what the series has to offer. If you’ve played previous entries in the series, you’re more likely to be left wishing there was more. Yara’s had its own revolution; perhaps it’s time for Far Cry to follow suit."
3265,173,Far Cry 6,65,GameGrin,"Oct  7, 2021","Far Cry 6 is two steps forward and a step back. The characters are brilliant, as is the work put into bringing them to life. Sadly, the game continues to be bogged down by more pointless content. The epitome of ‘less is more’."
3266,173,Far Cry 6,64,Riot Pixels,"Dec 23, 2021","Far Cry finally got rid of the most annoying bits (like the infamous towers), but that’s pretty much the extent of the series’ progress. Far Cry 6 doesn’t improve on the core concept in any way. Still, all the expected mechanics work as advertised and keep the game above the line."
3267,173,Far Cry 6,60,GAMINGbible,"Oct  6, 2021","I really wanted Far Cry 6 to be more than the previous games. A shake up of the formula that accounted for the violence of its setting. You're leading a revolution, starting a vicious civil war between entrenched factions, this is something open world games can reflect so well as areas of its land change based on your actions. But, disappointingly, it not only does little with its premise but is a poor version of things Far Cry has done well in the past."
3268,173,Far Cry 6,45,Stevivor,"Oct  6, 2021","Through an oversimplification of systems compared to previous entries in the franchise, everything in Far Cry 6 feels too safe…There isn’t any challenge to the combat, the exploration is mindless and the story that unfolds is completely unsatisfying."

Yes, Far Cry 6 is the accumulated chemical detritus from years of similar lab experiments, layered and stratified, compounded with time and pressure. But it isn’t a catalyst. I am. I played Far Cry 6 to completion: I pressed buttons to shoot guns and progress the plot; I killed an inordinate number of animals to buy upgrades; I equipped new pairs of pants to make myself stealthier. And at the end of it all, I felt nothing. I was unchanged by the experience."

The result will be After the Fall: not a perfect game – variety could use some work, especially – but the best action co-op ever developed in virtual reality, thanks to the experience and talent of one of the most skilled studios when it comes to injecting adrenaline and fun in VR."
3286,175,After the Fall,80,TierraGamer,"Jan 20, 2022","After the Fall delivers on its promise of an action shooter game in virtual reality, however, its lack of content rapidly makes the experience repetitive and tedious."
3287,175,After the Fall,80,Road to VR,"Dec 23, 2021","After the Fall executes its vision of Left 4 Dead in VR with gusto, as it brings much of what made Valve's four-player co-op great back 2008. There's still room for improvement when it comes to enemy variation and object interaction, but fans of arcade shooters may have a hard time knocking it on this alone, as it competently brings PC, PSVR, and Quest 2 in one big cross-platform splatter fest."
3288,175,After the Fall,80,Hey Poor Player,"Dec 17, 2021","If you’re a fan of Left 4 Dead and VR shooters, then After The Fall comes easily recommended. Its cross-platform co-op is an absolute blast regardless of which platform you’re playing on. And when it comes to replay value, the game’s loot and upgrade systems will keep you coming back for more as you work to craft the ultimate arsenal of zombie-killing hardware. Still, I can’t help but wish the game had just a little bit more to offer players out of the gate. Depending on which difficulty you choose, you can barrel through its five stages in just a few hours. And with just a handful of zombie types to encounter, things can start to feel a little repetitive after a while. Still, if you’re looking for Left 4 Dead-style thrills on your favorite headset, After The Fall is as close as you’re going to get, and a solid addition to any VR gamer’s library."
3289,175,After the Fall,80,GAMES.CH,"Dec 17, 2021","After The Fall is definitely a very entertaining VR game: with cracking action, great co-op and a terrific technical implementation. Whether it can motivate in the long term will depend on whether future updates can provide enough variety."
3290,175,After the Fall,80,Screen Rant,"Dec 10, 2021","Although After the Fall can be repetitive, it shines in its multiplayer capabilities and cross-platform options. Players can connect with their friends in VR to take out hordes of Snowbreed and challenge their skills against enemies like the Smasher, a massive Snowbreed monster with ice armor and a hammer-like arm. After the Fall is reminiscent of Left 4 Dead or Back 4 Blood's gameplay, but with an added level of immersion in VR that makes it a thrilling zombie-fighter experience. [Oculus Quest 2 Tested]"
3291,175,After the Fall,80,Android Central,"Dec  9, 2021","After the Fall is a 4-player co-op zombie shooter that pits players against the Snowbreed, a unique family of zombies that enjoy residence in post-apocalyptic snow-ridden LA. A glorious 80's setting with plenty of tropes fills the halls of this arcade shooter, begging players to kill more zombies in order to upgrade weapons and trudge through more difficult levels alongside their friends, all in the comfort of your favorite VR headset."
3292,175,After the Fall,78,Hobby Consolas,"Dec  9, 2021","It lacks content on release (more will be coming free in next months), but even that doesn't prevent it of being a great ""Left 4 Dead in virtual reality"", very enjoyable with friends thanks to cross platform play.

3293,175,After the Fall,74,Gaming Nexus,"Dec 20, 2021","After the Fall works best when four players are working together against hordes of swarming baddies. The shrieks and gun shots are exactly where you want them to be. But the game is held back some by a limited number of levels and some fiddly UI design. Still absolutely worth a look, but with the understanding that some refinements and more content are still on the way."
3294,175,After the Fall,70,Worth Playing,"Dec 21, 2021","I thoroughly enjoyed After the Fall for what it is: a VR Left 4 Dead clone with satisfying gameplay and some cool social VR settings that lay a solid foundation for the future. However, we don't know what that future looks like yet since we don't know how much content Vertigo will release in the coming years — and at what price. The included content is the bare minimum, and the game has a few issues to iron out before I can recommend it. That said, if you've been itching for co-op fun with some friends in VR regardless of the platform, AtF is a good choice if you can see pasts its numerous minor shortcomings at launch."

3297,175,After the Fall,62,Hooked Gamers,"Feb  1, 2022","After the Fall works well for the most part, giving players a VR version of Left 4 Dead. The gunplay and reloading mechanics are smooth and allow for immersion and tension as the hordes of zombies approach your small band. The user interface is well laid out and it is fun to shoot these undead with the small range of weapons at your disposal. Unfortunately, the length of the game and the issues with motion sickness caused by the jumpy rotation when turning may turn some people away. But if you want a Left 4 Dead style VR game, then After the Fall should be your go to option at this point."
3298,175,After the Fall,60,Hardcore Gamer,"Dec 15, 2021","After The Fall is yet another zombie VR shooter in the line of zombie VR shooters. The team that was responsible for Arizona Sunshine tries to build upon that with a cooperative experience that succeeds in that regard, but the overall experience isn’t that satisfying. The gun mechanics with the Oculus Quest 2 mostly work great and the PVP is a nice surprise, but the overall lack of current content and annoying bugs hurt the game at launch. The idea of a VR Left 4 Dead would work better if there weren’t already a ton of L4D clones on the market."

While I’m a bit irked I didn’t manage to 100% all the hidden content, the main game is still robust and satisfying. I don’t always enjoy puzzle games, but this one really impressed me. It’s honestly the best puzzle game I’ve played since Grindstone, though admittedly, both games are quite different. If you’re looking for something new to play, or if you just want to support an up-and-coming indie team, you owe it to yourself to check this out."

Unfortunately, the game doesn't have the personality, aesthetics or energy to stand toe-to-toe with the big guns. But the puzzles themselves show a confident understanding of good design and creativity. Ultimately that is the most important thing for a puzzle game, so hopefully, the developers get the chance to revisit what they've done here with a slightly broader vision. This team clearly has talent in spades."

An enjoyable cast of characters with great designs combined with an incredibly solid battle system facilitate an engaging story full of twists and turns.

The gorgeous visual style, superb voice acting, clever mechanics and emotive story-telling all combine together here to make an incredible title. Then, with the addition of comprehensive and innovative uses of time in all parts of the game, it becomes a near perfect experience. Cris Tales has arguably surpassed its JRPG inspirations and absolutely deserves your time (pun entirely intended)."
3309,177,Cris Tales,87,Everyeye.it,"Jul 22, 2021","Cris Tales is a delightful adventure, which will not fail to satisfy players looking for a fairytale and well-structured experience. The JRPG born in Colombia is a small jewel capable of bringing charismatic characters and well-conceived twists to the stage, without however renouncing a stimulating gameplay and a leading artistic sector. With Cris Tales, Dreams Uncorporated and SYCK touch excellence, missing it only by a whisker, for an epic journey through time that we feel we can recommend without reservation. The authors of the epic of Crisbell and companions thus add a new Indie to the realm of small independent pearls, for an IP and a concept that we hope will find further iteration at the Colombian team studios."

3312,177,Cris Tales,80,Gameblog.fr,"Sep 13, 2021","Cris Tales is the first game from the Colombians studio Dreams Uncorporated, and it's rather impressive, with a deliciously retro feeling, a charming design mixing pastels, 2D and 3D, very pleasant for the eyes despite some optimization concerns, even on PS5, where DualSense is not very well supported. What makes Cris Tales original is not its classic scenario, but the powers of its protagonist, who can see both the past and the future at the same time. In game, it means a screen cut in three, and we can have fun moving the camera to observe the destiny and life of an NPC by running from left to right. In combat, it's quite exhilarating, since it will be necessary to mix temporal and elemental mechanics to overcome his enemies. Clearly, Cris Tales is a very humble and charming little game, and if this is your kind of game, you should look into its case."

It delivers a wonderfully satisfying story about a group of troubled individuals striving to save the world for their own reasons, and along the way finding a place to belong with each other. Hilarious characters like Willhelm keep things from getting too stressful, and Crisbell's powerful Time Mage abilities lead to some intriguing narrative choices, fun puzzles, and engaging combat. The game's final moments are not conclusive enough to tie everything up in a satisfying way, but the journey to get there is one well worth taking."

Sadly, it falls a bit short of its grand potential due to some mechanical and balance issues and a final act that badly overstays its welcome.

Pairing that with time manipulation mechanics and a beloved genre, Cris Tales could have been one of the better games to come out of 2021. Unfortunately, a lack of diverse enemy types, standard combat, and some questionable difficulty progression outweigh the highest highs, making Cris Tales feel too out of place alongside its cohorts."

The dubbing in VO is also of good quality, even if it sometimes tends to break the rhythm a bit. It's a pity that the animations are a bit stiff and that the software suffers from some lags during the fights. The latter, although pleasant, are also a bit too easy and frequent, giving a feeling of exaggerated repetitiveness. On the other hand, the title has a good lifespan. The presence of unmarked enemies and the recurrent loading can also be criticized. Nevertheless, even if we would have appreciated a more mature story, it is pleasant to follow and the gameplay playing with time works very well."

Unplugged delivers that spark, that flutter in your chest, those hairs on the back of your neck that stand up, as you fire up the game and crunch your way through its 20-ish tracks. After a few drinks at a gig, the air guitar inevitably comes out, as I’m screaming lyrics to some of my favourite tunes. Now, I can do this in the comfort of my own home, without inflicting this misery on other people – and so can you!"

Which is pretty cool! If you’ve got a head for rhythm games, along with a lingering fondness for timeless rock songs, there’s a lot to latch on to here. The hand tracking is better than you’d expect, although there are a couple of choke points to contend with. Furthermore, those quality motion controls can’t stop certain finger positions from being real bone-breakers.

Better cameras on the headset are a minimum requirement for that to happen. In the meantime, if you can put up with its inevitable frustrations as you air-jam a hallucinated guitar to the tune of rock classics in your living room, Unplugged is one of the best and only games to use hand tracking.

But unfortunately, the half-baked 50th-anniversary mode and missteps with the mind-numbing career mode, distract from the overall experience. WRC 10 shines when it’s not trying to lure you in with a load of flashy bullshit. Instead, it’s best when it’s got you on the track, careering through chicanes or clinging on for dear life as you hoist yourself through a hairpin."

We take real pleasure in terms of racing sensations and a total change of scenery on some specials, despite the recurring lack of staging and some technical flaws (tearing, cliping ...).

It might not be the biggest leap in improvements, but the refinement of the vehicle control, the improved physics, new tweaks to the career – just as time-consuming as last year’s – and the increased legendary car/track count help make the return to the series a good one. There is just a bit too much deja vu here that might put off casual fans from buying the game if they already have WRC 9. Sadly, that is one of the downsides that come with these yearly sports releases. Still, I can recommend WRC 10 to the people who want a new racing game, and those who are into motorsports will find WRC 10 a great title to play with, just make sure you try to go for the full wheel set up to truly experience throwing a car around these amazingly designed courses."

The stable manager mode is also welcome, although it is still not understood why you have to end the previously mentioned mode in order to be able to access it. Undoubtedly the most striking feature is of course the arrival of the choice of tire allocation for the rally, which adds a good layer of strategy in certain events including the Monte-Carlo. Unfortunately, we feel that COVID has had its work, whether it is the proposed rallies that are no longer really in line with the 2021 calendar, more technical aspects of the game that have not changed a bit. Do not forget either that the license will change creamery in 2023, from KT Racing / Nacon to Codemasters / EA. This WRC 10 is therefore the penultimate opus of the French studio which will still have had the merit of bringing the series out of the mediocrity in which it stagnated, during the time when Milestone was in charge (the Metacritic ratings are from 80% on average during the Evolution Studios era to 60% during the Milestone era)"

At the very least, the game’s somewhat-warped screen display and drenching in ’80s culture tropes is anything but off-putting. The problem then lies with its simplicity of delivery and the game’s general lack of appeasing those looking for something more than surface-level attraction. A world that too often feels unnecessarily padded on a level design basis; a combat system though not terrible, feels a little too undecided on what it exactly wants to be. And beyond that, a story/narrative the game really could’ve gone without given how little relevance or even impact it holds on a player’s progression. Venturing through the Digital Kingdom does spark some moments of delight. But beyond its art-style and fond execution on aesthetic, Narita Boy‘s unenthusiastic lack of originality and care for its overarching design, winds up carving out a satisfactory yet tepid debut for Studio Koba."

The new campaign's high challenge level and relatively short length of the main quest may put some off, but, everything considered, The Battle of Steeltown is the perfect continuation of an already excellent experience."
3412,183,Wasteland 3: The Battle of Steeltown,76,The Games Machine,"Jun  7, 2021","Wasteland 3: The Battle of Steeltown offers enough content to intrigue even the most hardened Rangers. It doesn't last long, but the quality/price ratio is definitely excellent."
3413,183,Wasteland 3: The Battle of Steeltown,75,IGN Italia,"Jun  3, 2021","A fine DLC that adds some more hours of solid Wasteland 3 content, with the usual mixture of tactical combat, open-ended gameplay and more than a few choices that can alter the story. It's not flawless, nor is it the most ambitious expansion ever made, but if you're looking for an excuse to come back to the frozen wastelands of Colorado, The Battle of Steeltown can provide another 7-8 hours of good content."
3414,183,Wasteland 3: The Battle of Steeltown,75,PC Invasion,"Jun  3, 2021","Wasteland 3: The Battle of Steeltown has a few notable flaws, and it's also a fairly short romp. However, there's enough content and tactical depth to make you want to keep adventuring in this post-apocalyptic landscape."
3415,183,Wasteland 3: The Battle of Steeltown,70,CD-Action,"Jul 23, 2021","The first story DLC for the truly great RPG is simply okay. Wasteland fans will enjoy the new adventure, although it isn’t long (6-7 hours) and offers almost nothing you haven’t already seen in the base game. Be aware that you can’t play this DLC after completing the original story – you either need a save you made before “the point of no return”, or you have to start over and reach at least level 9. What a nonsense! [08/2021, p.46]"
3416,183,Wasteland 3: The Battle of Steeltown,70,Jeuxvideo.com,"Jun 10, 2021","With its new quests, the proliferation of choices with strong consequences, its new weapons and new ideas that bring a tactical overlay to the confrontations, Steeltown does what is expected of it: to deliver an experience in the right lineage of Wasteland 3. We would undoubtedly have liked a more finished product, free of bugs that hang out here and there or a slightly longer story, but fans of the original game should easily find their account in this expansion."
3417,183,Wasteland 3: The Battle of Steeltown,67,COGconnected,"Jun 21, 2021","Thankfully, the humorous writing is still there and I will admit that Wasteland 3: The Battle of Steeltown got a few chuckles out of me. The environment and models for the area also look awesome, and the unique flair of folk-tunes makes a great return (I just wish there was more). Overall, Battle of Steeltown is decent but if you are a Wasteland fan, I would recommend you wait for a sale to pick this one up."
3418,183,Wasteland 3: The Battle of Steeltown,60,GameCritics,"Aug 31, 2021","The Battle of Steeltown is a well-written piece of additional content for Wasteland 3 that doesn’t quite live up to expectations due to its experimental approach to combat and short running time. It’s a pleasant enough playthrough for a few hours despite the difficulty spikes, but it’s ultimately a compelling enough reason to come back to Colorado."

Of course, every player will take something different away from their experience playing, but it is an experience that I highly recommend. With beautiful designs, excellent characters, and a great soundtrack, No Longer Home is well worth picking up."
3420,184,No Longer Home,90,Gamer Escape,"Aug  9, 2021","No Longer Home tackles the issues it presents in a natural, unobtrusive way that allows the player space to muse on them themselves. Even if you’re not sure you can directly relate to the situation that Ao and Bo find themselves in, this title comes highly recommended. It will absolutely remind you of experiences in your past, and it just might help make the stresses of the future seem a little less daunting."
3421,184,No Longer Home,80,GAMINGbible,"Jul 29, 2021","The game was made by a modest team over the course of four years, grappling with the thousands of miles between the two lead developers in the UK and in Japan. There are a small number of quibbles I have, like the fact that it is sometimes difficult to know who is speaking out of the expanded cast of characters and that it'd be great to have a switch that lets the dialogue flow between the two so I can focus on the shifting settings. However, I recognise that it's a deeply personal project and one that has been shared with the world. For those in need of hunkering down while a silent storm rages on every side, I recommend No Longer Home."

3424,184,No Longer Home,72,Merlin'in Kazanı (Turkey),"Aug 17, 2021",No Longer Home is able to give the player all that he wants to give. It delivers exactly what is expected of a short and personal story. I would have liked to play the story of Ao and Bo a little longer.
3425,184,No Longer Home,72,Impulsegamer,"Aug  9, 2021","In terms of would I recommend the game… that’s not easy to answer. Given the length of “play time”I would certainly start by suggesting waiting for a sale. If you are after a lot of interaction then I’d say avoid it. If you quite like choose your own adventures or indie theatre performances then this might just be up your alley. If you feel non binary or just overwhelmed at what life has in store for you while studying or after completing study… this might be the familiar voice you want to hear. It’s far more an experience than a game so if that’s your thing then give it a try, if not then look elsewhere."
3426,184,No Longer Home,70,GameCritics,"Aug 31, 2021","Personally, I can honestly attest to being drawn in by the charm of the simple narrative while watching two characters struggle to find their way around gender fluidity. At the heart of it, these two are trying to find direction in their lives and I felt that I could relate. If one likes narrative titles with a clear purpose and interesting look, No Longer Home recieves my personal recommendation."

3429,184,No Longer Home,70,Hey Poor Player,"Aug  9, 2021","No Longer Home is a short, sad story about coming to terms with growing up and saying goodbye to college life, friends, and the family we create along the way. Although Ao and Bo must leave their uni flat and the happy memories they’ve created within those four walls behind, they’ll cherish every precious moment spent together. If you’re looking to experience the pain of parting while taking solace in the fact that home is truly where the heart is, No Longer Home will scratch that melancholy itch."
3430,184,No Longer Home,60,Multiplayer.it,"Aug 29, 2021","No Longer Home is evidently a heartfelt video game narration created with love by a duo that shared an important part of life. Unfortunately, its derivative nature and the briefness of the narration are the proponents of a missed empathic experience that could have hit harder than it does."
3431,184,No Longer Home,60,COGconnected,"Aug 11, 2021","Overall, it was hard to care for Ao and Bo’s story. The dialog was a slog. The character’s perspectives often changed too fast. And while going over their dilemmas, again and again, I found myself not wanting to play anymore. I’d rather just go out for a beer and talk to them in person and let them know life is going to be okay. High school and college are but footnotes in hopefully a long healthy story of yourself. In the end, if you find yourself at this particular time in life, it might be worth experiencing their story. But if you’re past it, you may not find much here to resonate with."
3432,185,Medieval Dynasty,80,PC Invasion,"Sep 27, 2021","Medieval Dynasty is a survival RPG that manages to stand out in the oversaturated market that it occupies. By combining ideas from several other popular franchises, developer Render Cube has managed to create a genuinely unique product.

3437,185,Medieval Dynasty,75,GamingTrend,"Oct  1, 2021","Like some sort of peasant Animal Crossing, Medieval Dynasty casts us in the role of mayor of Dysentery Village. You’ll slowly grow from labor-intensive shacks to a semi-self-sufficient hamlet through the sweat of your brow, building a dynasty that will last generations. You’ll just wish your peons would pitch in and carry their own water...and stop eating the buckets."
3438,185,Medieval Dynasty,75,Gamepressure,"Sep 22, 2021","Medieval Dynasty won’t reinvent the wheel of the survival or resource management genres, but it will give you a relaxing and low-key experience you can customize to your liking.

Even though the constant backtracking might be a pain, I personally found the game’s slow pace relaxing rather than annoying and enjoyed my time with it. Plus there are a lot of options that let you simplify the experience and lower the difficulty level, so you don’t need to be a hardcore survival games fan to have fun with Medieval Dynasty.

While there are still clearly some stark improvements that can be made, I think that Medieval Dynasty succeeded in bringing something new to an already saturated and stale genre, and can be a lasting favorite, as long as they continue to make improvements and provide updates."

Medieval Dynasty is like a distant cousin of Animal Crossing - an FPP game on a budget, without multiplayer, but available on PC. It's worth playing once version 1.0 debuts. If you're new to this game and genre, I assure you - it is a survival like no other."
3446,185,Medieval Dynasty,60,PC Games,"Oct 16, 2021","Medieval Dynasty feels unfinished in many ways. Yes, it looks amazing and does a great job bringing the middle ages to life. The negatives overshadow the positives, however. The story is missing synchronization and traveling the vast distances between villages is exhausting because of missing fast travel points. There are many more things that really frustrated us. If you are not in for the interesting setting, there’s really not that much here to have fun with."

3448,186,Century: Age of Ashes,80,Impulsegamer,"Jan 24, 2022",Most unique game I've played in a long time. The overall presentation of the game is really good. The game would have been perfect if matchmaking wasn't so broken.
3449,186,Century: Age of Ashes,80,GameCritics,"Jan 18, 2022","As much as I enjoyed my time in Century : Age of Ashes, I do have wonder how much staying power it will have. Since all classes are viable in each mode, I suspect many players may stick with one character class, get invested, and not explore the rest of what the game has to offer. As an example, I found myself only switching to other classes if the daily mission or hatching a dragon egg specifically required it. Also, due to the limited amount of content that is currently present, a busy player will see nearly everything within a couple of hours. Despite those concerns, the game looks great, each class is enjoyable to play, and each match is maybe 20 minutes at most — perfect for quick sessions."

3451,186,Century: Age of Ashes,80,Screen Rant,"Dec  6, 2021","In its current state, Century: Age of Ashes is a gorgeous game with a solid concept and premise that is unbelievably fun to play, and developers at Playwing have set it up with plenty of room to grow. The different match types are high-energy, with tight and exciting combat to suit a variety of playstyles. Co-op game modes like Spoils of War and Gates of Fire are clear standouts with their focus on more cooperative play and clearer objectives for teams beyond killing opponents. The microtransactions that are present allow players to pay to look cool and collect new gear and dragon styles, but not to win, which is a breath of fresh air given the state of most free-to-play online gaming models. Century: Age of Ashes deserves to be recognized for its polish and stellar execution from day one and is definitely a game that fans of fast-paced and energetic PvP should keep an eye on."

3457,186,Century: Age of Ashes,50,TheSixthAxis,"Feb  1, 2022","I’ve found myself disappointed with Century: Age of Ashes. There is a fairly solid central PvP F2P game here but nothing to make it stand out aside from the presentation. The modes are basic and repetitive and levelling up takes so long it seems set to encourage spending real money on cosmetic upgrades. On the surface this looked like the game my teenage self dreamed of, but like most teenage dreams, this mainly results in sore wrists and a feeling of shame and disappointment."

The mix of genres is done masterfully, and the potential here is off the charts. That’s to say nothing of the fact that it’s hard-as-nails, is going to be getting loads of updates, and is also rather pretty to look at too. If any of this sounds good to you, I implore you to dive on in, you won’t regret it."
3459,187,Tribes of Midgard,90,Screen Rant,"Jul 26, 2021","With a large map to explore and progression that is smooth and inviting to even beginner survival gamers, Tribes of Midgard is a great fit for those who have wanted to immerse themselves in open-world exploration but have been nervous to try hardcore titles like Valheim. With a focus on the magic and fantasy of Viking mythology, this game is also a great fit for younger audiences who want to play with friends. Tribes of Midgard offers players engaging survival mechanics with unique design choices that make gameplay a rewarding experience. With a few expansions to the base building options, Tribes of Midgard would be a well-rounded and unique option for survival-style gameplay."
3460,187,Tribes of Midgard,85,Gaming Nexus,"Aug  9, 2021","Tribes of Midgard struggles with an outside force it has no control over that prevents it from being near perfect; it requires friends to play with. Alone, or with strangers who don’t work together there is just too much going on at once, making the game feel like an endless assault of chores that need done right away. But if you can get a regular group, taking down the seasonal boss is totally worth the effort."
3461,187,Tribes of Midgard,84,COGconnected,"Jul 27, 2021","It is not often that a game attempts to fuse elements from so many genres. Usually, the result weakens the overall experience but Tribes of Midgard is that rare exception, a game in which all the disparate parts resonate and reinforce each other. The early levels can grow a bit repetitive but exploration, crafting, and combat continue to engage throughout. Tribes of Midgard should appeal to fans of action RPGs, survival games, co-op PvE and of course, the rich tapestry of Viking combat, lore, and culture."

The solo experience features all of the intensity that comes with the time crunch, but very little of the fun, and it’s certainly not for players who might be looking for another chill Valheim-like viking experience. But for what it sets out to do, it executes it well. Tribes of Midgard successfully evokes that feeling of setting out as a united tribe in its multiplayer sessions, and the heart of the game lies in sharing the burden of fighting that ticking clock and hoping that you can all pull together in time to beat the odds."

Still, it deserves your time and attention now, especially if you’re a fan of swiftly getting a system down perfectly and don’t mind repeatedly dying in an effort to achieve that. Once Tribes of Midgard comes into its own — and it will — it’s safe to say it’ll be a pretty addicting experience."

Increasingly long nights mean you get little and less time to explore, and this is exacerbated by growing demands on resources. Instead, Tribes of Midgard would have made a better open-world game—its procedurally-generated Norse realm is so explorable. I would gladly play Tribes of Midgard more if I wasn’t bound to the settlement as much, and I hope that’s a mode that could be explored in the future."

A sandbox with an intriguing setting, albeit artistically uninspired, which offers a type of approach to the genre by virtue of accessibility and cooperation: in short, the shy but dignified starting point for Norsfell. A team that thus sets foot in a market that is quite inflated in itself, laying the foundations for an experience that - if duly supported, especially in terms of content - could prove to be an excellent opportunity to engage in fierce survival challenges with friends.

3483,188,Watch Dogs: Legion - Bloodline,70,Windows Central,"Jul  8, 2021","Bloodline represents Ubisoft going back to its roots on the Watch Dogs franchise, and your mileage will vary. Either way, it doesn't feel like a Legion DLC."
3484,188,Watch Dogs: Legion - Bloodline,70,Stevivor,"Jul  6, 2021","Despite its strong narrative focus, Bloodline is a sequel to Pearce’s Watch Dogs but a prequel to the events of Watch Dogs Legion; as such, we (at least partially) know what will happen next. I’m glad we had a chance to dip into Pearce’s journey again, but I’m hoping that any subsequent dealings with the character will be fully forward in time. If you’re a fan of Watch Dogs Legion — and Watch Dogs in general — the price of admission is certainly worth it."

Without characters to study, befriend, and recruit, Bloodline is a more watered-down open-world experience than the base game it's tied to. Worse is the fact that it doesn't expand on the base game at all. With no new regions to explore, activities to engage in, or gear to unlock, it's a pretty barebones package overall."

It allows you to feel what in reality you already experience in real life like the pain of losing someone dear, the sadness of wasted years, the urgency of fixing something instead of preventing it and the anxiety of wanting something to happen, and it failing to do so. It is really easy to play with Mo, through a controller, than to play yourself in real life. It’s almost comforting to play through Minute of Islans because of that. Having this said, we believe that the game is very well made and achieves the purposed it was designed for, in a society in which we are all prisoners of a virus and the will to regain normality is always looking around the corner."

I think that playing through Minute of Islands is worth your time if you enjoy dark themed stories and distinctive art, but don’t come with high expectations for the puzzles or platforming."

The origin of some parts and the reasons for others; strong and as impactful its opening remains, the game’s eventual unraveling sadly falls short of delivering on that early, promising, cleverly-distorted appearance. Pleasant that visual style and detail with its imagery remains throughout — a couple of instances where that combining of color and complexity does strike one or two favorable moments — Minute of Islands‘ unaltered, more-of-the-same approach to everything other than its imagery feels fated to be easily forgotten the moment the credits roll."
3500,190,The Ascent,92,COGconnected,"Jul 29, 2021","Setting aside it coming from such a small team, I think The Ascent is miraculous in a couple of ways. First, the detailed world-building, environmental storytelling, and atmosphere are maybe the best expression of the cyberpunk aesthetic I've ever seen in a game. Second, the developers have seemingly cataloged every annoying mechanic in RPGs and action games -- from death to rapid travel to inventory management -- and found a way to make them less onerous or disappear altogether. The Ascent is not an easy game, either mechanically or thematically, but it is completely engaging if for no other reason than to see into a very convincingly realized future."

3502,190,The Ascent,90,Shacknews,"Aug 13, 2021","The Ascent succeeds at delivering an action-shooter with challenging enemies and a diverse set of levels to explore. This is bolstered by a rich universe that’s practically bursting with interesting lore at every seam. Despite some wonkiness with the in-game map layout, it’s a quite enjoyable experience, especially if you decide to go online and team up with friends. The Ascent is a vastly impressive first outing for Neon Giant, and one that sets the bar high for the studio’s future endeavors."

Scratches that neon lit cyberpunk aesthetic itch just right."
3504,190,The Ascent,90,Checkpoint Gaming,"Jul 29, 2021","The Ascent proves why the cyberpunk genre is so popular right now. There isn’t anything exactly different or unique about its story, but it perfects the atmosphere with terrific environment art and an otherworldly soundtrack. Combine that with outstanding twin-stick shooter gameplay and elements of wall cover, cool-down management, and role-playing to deepen the experience. Blasting through crews of Rojins with a rocket-firing gun, the Astrosmasher, being among my personal highlights. It may have accessibility and minor performance concerns, but it’s still sensational, action-packed, and so much fun. The Ascent may be the best cyberpunk game in the last year."

The narrative will carry you along to many interesting places with different baddies to fry, though a few encounters feature enemies that are pure bullet sponges. You will need to pick the right equipment and keep up with leveling, but these issues can be overcome. Hardware requirements shouldn't hold you back too much, and glitches are few and far between. The overall quality makes this one a must play for cyberpunk and isometric shooter fans."

I’m certain the devs will support this title for many months to come, addressing it’s most urgent issues, i.e. stiff difficulty level, poorly implemented fast travel or lack of endgame (including insufficient depth of itemization). Before the end of the quarter, the game could be upgraded enough to deserve a score like 8.5, and in the long term, I can imagine it ascending even higher. But can you resist these graphics?"
3512,190,The Ascent,80,IGN Japan,"Aug 30, 2021","The Ascent is an ambitious game that incorporates body modification, heavy weaponry and corporate war.

3515,190,The Ascent,80,VG247,"Jul 29, 2021","The Ascent’s ambition is often the most surprising thing about it. I went in expecting a decent, simple cyberpunk top-down shooter. Instead, I got a compelling action game that feels great to play, and an introduction into a world I can’t wait to see expanded in future sequels. The Ascent is the type of indie superstar game you bring up to prove how much can be accomplished by a small team today."
3516,190,The Ascent,80,Jeuxvideo.com,"Jul 29, 2021","Beautiful to fall for, fun and nervous, The Ascent is a generous twin stick shooter, which evolves in a coherent world with neat lore. If the optimization of the game as the ergonomics of the navigation or the interface remain to be reviewed and can sometimes be frustrating, the whole is sufficiently solid on its shoot part as an RPG to occupy you for long hours, solo or with friends . A great way to get back on track for the small team of Neon Giant, whose game is available as soon as it is released on the Game Pass."

I won’t write my thesis on its commentary on capitalism, but I’ll fondly remember my co-op sessions where I tore through this cyberpunk world. That being said, the shallow RPG elements, lack of meaningful narrative, and exploration frustration were constants that really dragged the experience down.

Veles is a brutal, unforgiving world, but it's one I enjoyed blasting my way through...when the game was being fair about it. Navigating the menus is a chore, but building a character is fun and the story is interesting enough that I don't mind the technical issues that pop up. It's not a perfect game, but if this is the beginning of a new franchise then it's a solid foundation from which to make its Ascent."
3529,190,The Ascent,70,IGN Portugal,"Aug  6, 2021","It's impossible not to be impressed by The Ascent's graphics and presentation: Veles has a remarkable vividness, while it manages to be simultaneously crushing and suffocating.

Yet for all its facelessness, what was most indelible was still its city, the disparity between the powerful and powerless depicted in its spaces: from the cramped, unsanitary alleys home to the ceaseless chatter of its most downtrodden, to the shine of the marble floor in the wealthier districts, soon to be sullied by the dead bodies you leave behind."

The setting is successful, it picks up the essence of the Cyberpunk style, giving it a further point of decadence and an extra element with the alien touch, with interesting character designs and offers an interesting action proposal that may fall short too. The biggest drawback comes in its optimization where there are many rough edges that present problems."

Let's hope Neon Digital will be able to take us back in it with some tweaks."
3541,190,The Ascent,60,Edge Magazine,"Aug 14, 2021","That becomes a bigger problem late in the game, where it resorts to the cheapest method of raising the difficulty by simply throwing high-level enemies at you in increasing numbers. In one battle, you're tasked with holding a position for a given amount of time, before being told that isn't enough; you must now finish off all the remaining enemies. At which point it has become clear that no matter how effective the synergy of our augs, mods and weapons may be, our survival hinges upon us grinding side-quests to raise our level.

3545,190,The Ascent,60,GameSpot,"Jul 29, 2021","Even if The Ascent was fully functional and balanced in a way where building up a character to become the ultimate Indent warrior felt great, there's the fact that so much of the game is designed to feel like servitude. As you climb the superstructure housing all of Veles, you serve a progression of masters, and the payoff for the game's central mystery--where did the mysterious group running Veles suddenly run off to?--isn't nearly enough to offset the hopeless grind. Your bosses insult you when you go on your task, ignore you when you've done well, and provide no rewards for success. For so much of the play time, The Ascent feels like, well, an uphill battle."

The world-building is appealing visually and aurally, but it’s ultimately unsatisfying and often unrewarding during exploration. The lack of replayability, broken cooperative play, bugs, and unbalanced artificial enemy difficulty make it tough to appreciate its positive elements.

Those moments are memorable and are unfortunately far less common than The Ascent’s pitfalls. I’m right near the end of the game’s main story after crossing off plenty of side missions, but with the charm of The Ascent’s firefights and scenery long since expired, there’s nothing much left to inspire confidence in what remains."

It’s a much more thought out experience, much closer to the original idea the team at Oddworld Inhabitants had for it way back in the early 90s.

Nevertheless, being able to step into a new Oddworld experience in 2021 is something to behold.

Of course, it also has far too many bugs that force restarts to circumvent, and that can turn the frustration of a good challenge into the bad, controller-throwing kind, and the sound design is all over the place."

It's an enjoyable ride that is made infinitely better by playing with friends, but not inherently hurt by running solo either. This game takes the best parts from other looter-shooters and the best aspects of sci-fi RPGs and blends these elements into an experience that is worth diving into because of its high replayability, customizable play style, and fun story.

The core gameplay loop is fun, incredibly so when it clicks, the loot system is well thought out and wielding the powers of the Anomaly is power-tripping. But the game is also a slow burner, enemy variety is disappointingly poor, there is no scaling of content for party members of lower levels, and audio and animations aren’t always that great. But the core is good, and we have faith that People Can Fly will polish those rough edges."

For those who want a pick-up and put-down RPG with an emphasis on story, Outriders has that covered. For those who want hundreds of hours of gameplay in tense and adrenaline-pumping combat with powerful builds, Outriders has that covered too. Ultimately, the strength of Outriders is how it connects to its players and what they want out of the game, meaning everyone walks away feeling different about it, and that can only be a good thing."
3570,192,Outriders,80,GamingTrend,"Apr 14, 2021","Despite all of the ways that Outriders is stuck in the past, the moment to moment gameplay is so compelling that it’s impossible to say it’s not a blast -- especially with friends. It’s also remarkably expansive in its crafting and skill trees, with plenty of ways to customize your playstyle. I may not be that invested in the story, and this certainly isn’t that different from most first person shooters, but Outriders is well worth the time and effort. Even if there may be extra effort put in because of crappy server connections."

Other players have reported losing their entire inventories or having consistent fatal errors. The game flat-out doesn’t feel complete. Again, though, I have cleared the story campaign, so Outriders has a few things going for it. I’d like to see a sequel that addresses some of this, by getting rid of the always-online functionality, ditching some of the petty annoyances like how fast travel works between zones, and generally getting the game to a place where it doesn’t crash every hour or so. As it stands, it’s good, but obnoxious, and might be better after a few solid patches."
3572,192,Outriders,80,GameSpot,"Apr  7, 2021","The moments where Outriders is taking daring swings at mixing disparate elements are when it's at its best. The game is surprisingly deft at combining things that shouldn't work together: Its story is often funny but similarly severe; its combat requires you to take cover and to charge; its abilities make you phenomenally powerful but prone to overestimating yourself. If you can find the balance in Outriders, People Can Fly's RPG-shooter finds ways to combine well-worn video game ideas into something new and fun. Especially when you're accompanied by friends and put the time in to really understand the game's systems, Outriders rewards you with epic battle moments and a sprawling scope. It left me wanting to continue venturing out into the wilds of Enoch to see what I might find there--and to smash whatever it was with seismic earthquake magic."

The title from People Can Fly and Square Enix recites the ranges of the perfect Looter-Shooter while abandoning the Game as a Service dimension inherent in this type of game. It stands out first and foremost with its science-fiction-inspired universe, fantasy and punk movement. The explosiveness of its combat, its extremely well thought-out customization system and this propensity to motivate players with ubiquitous power gain make this Shooter-RPG an outsider to consider. However, the anecdotal scenario, the sketchy staging, the redundancy of the missions and the instability of the game do not allow Outriders to fully assert itself on the Looter-Shooter scene."

3585,192,Outriders,70,GamesRadar+,"Apr  8, 2021","Outriders is a brash and bold looter shooter that will keep you entertained through the campaign and side missions, but its endgame content gets repetitive fast."
3586,192,Outriders,70,TheGamer,"Apr  6, 2021","Outriders would have been a much better game had the campaign been half as long and the end game had twice as much content. I had fun exploring the dozen or so environments throughout the story mode, but the game doesn’t start firing on all cylinders until the gear you get becomes meaningful. The disposable nature of gear during the campaign/leveling process makes the game feel a lot more shallow than it actually is, and getting players to that end-game grind sooner would likely have exposed a lot more players to the best that Outriders has to offer. I hope that Outriders gets DLC, but only if it’s content that builds out the end game even further. If an Outriders expansion is just another story-driven campaign, I likely won’t even bother playing. If I do, I’ll almost certainly set the difficulty to easy, skip all the cutscenes, and rush to the new end game. If you’re playing Outriders for the first time, I highly recommend you do the same."

While it has a lot of features that I'm not fond of, the core gameplay is solid enough to easily carry the rest of the experience. If you're into looter shooter or dungeon crawler games, Outriders will scratch that itch — if you can play it. With its current matchmaking and server issues, we cannot help but score it lower than we'd like.

3630,194,Tandem: A Tale of Shadows,70,Hardcore Gamer,"Oct 21, 2021","Tandem: A Tale of Shadows may be guilty of taking from any and every corner of the genre in constructing its challenges. But while it may zip from one set-up to the next — less-than-concerned with the through-line that ties it all together — the perspective-shifting, requiring of balancing overhead and side-scrolling puzzle-solving alike, just about delivers on the promise its set-up initially paints. Not just on the basis of a satisfying series of environments to conquer, but an admittedly-brief fascination on how everything ends up unravelling, let alone solved. It’s not everyday you stop to marvel for a second at the way two perspectives can play out at once, but that very trait is what Tandem: A Tale of Shadows shines on and in the end utilizes sufficiently well."
3631,194,Tandem: A Tale of Shadows,70,Hey Poor Player,"Oct 21, 2021","Tandem: A Tale of Shadows is a fun puzzle-platformer that will absolutely please fans of the genre and/or Tim Burton. Don’t let its creepy cute demeanor fool you — these puzzles are definitely on the cerebral side and will take some time to tease that solution out. I can see this being a terrific Halloween title for streamers who don’t love the typical scary fare for this spooky holiday but still want to please their followers. In the very least, this little treat has a few tricks up its sleeve that make Tandem: A Tale of Shadows worth the price of admission."

The almost complete lack of narrative thrust and droning gameplay progression drag it down from the moment it begins, and its failure to capitalize on its more attention-grabbing elements guarantees a disappointing experience out of a game that could have easily been more."

3635,195,Killsquad,78,The Games Machine,"Oct 22, 2021","Killsquad is a game that evolved significantly since it first arrived onto Early Access two years ago, and the result is a solid twin-stick shooter with looter elements. When it comes to loot drops, the balance is unfortunately a bit off, but overall the game is a fun mix of genres."
3636,195,Killsquad,75,GamingTrend,"Dec  7, 2021","Whether you’re playing solo or co-op, Killsquad’s skill-based, challenging, and fast paced combat is a triumph. While the lacklustre mission design and unexciting loot end up letting it down a little, this one can still be a blast to jump into if you and your friends are up for a grind."

3638,195,Killsquad,70,DarkZero,"Oct 25, 2021","Killsquad is a good attempt at merging a few ideas from other genres and coming up with an arcade-style isometric shooter with a loot grind. The action loop is solid, and the high enemy count makes for some frantic action that merges quick ability activation with the player’s own skill. It falls short in some elements, such as no end game content and a loot grind that is too focused on the shop rather than rewards through contracts, and could do with a better diverse set of abilities and weapons for each character. Still, this is a game that is easy to jump into, and even if the end game does not exist, taking the game as an experience from the first to the last contract is good enough to recommend, think of it as an isometric shooter rather than an action RPG. One thing though is that make sure you have yourself a friendly bounty hunter or three to come along with you to get the best experience from this entertaining, blaster action game."
3639,195,Killsquad,68,Hooked Gamers,"Nov 24, 2021","Procedurally generated and varied maps do wonders in keeping what is, at its core, a simple and unchanging gameplay loop feeling fresh, albeit samey. Taking down bosses feels like an achievement, and the difficulty is well balanced. The few online contracts I took showed that the classes complement each other well."
3640,195,Killsquad,60,Eurogamer Italy,"Nov 17, 2021",Killsquad is a game that mixes a lot of genres and tries to be a lot of things together. It succeeds only partially due to a limited depth and an uninspired art direction.
3641,195,Killsquad,60,TheSixthAxis,"Nov  2, 2021","Killsquad feels like a game that’s taking a long time to cook. As much as I enjoyed my time playing it, it didn't always hold my attention, lacking a certain special quality. While it's already come on leaps and bounds, I hope Killsquad continues to improve with time."

3647,196,Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2,80,Jeuxvideo.com,"Jun 15, 2021","Rather complete and benefiting from a significant visual improvement, Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 has been able to emancipate itself from its predecessor without denigrating it. While remaining faithful to the principles of the first episode, this sequel relies on immersive and spectacular ultra-long-distance spots. The developers have chosen a path that may not appeal to everyone, but in our opinion, these sequences provide additional variety. The free phases, between action and infiltration, are still present and the overall experience is very solid. CI Games is mastering its subject more and more and demonstrating it once again."
3648,196,Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2,75,GameCritics,"Aug 20, 2021","If one can stomach the questionable story choices, Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 has some of the most engaging sniping action around. Whether a player wants to simply click a button and watch a slo-mo bullet explode a head, or whether they want to be forced to calculate exactly how far an enemy will walk in the one and a half seconds between the bullet leaving the barrel and closing the deadly distance, SGWC2 scales exactly to any level of interest and skill. It may be brutally violent, but it’s an intensely satisfying sniper experience."
3649,196,Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2,75,COGconnected,"Jul  6, 2021","Players of the first Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts game will find this second game an all-around improvement, especially in mission design and pacing. The story is a bland concoction of cultural and military stereotypes but it does a proper job of setting the stage for the action, which can be very satisfying, at least at sniping distance. The less open-world nature of the campaign keeps things moving and the large toybox of gadgets and weapons is there for players to use, or not. I wish Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 had a more engaging set of characters and better action combat outside the sniping mechanics, but the game is a well-made step in the right direction for the franchise."
3650,196,Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2,75,Softpedia,"Jun 14, 2021","I don't feel that Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 is a major upgrade over the previous title, but the presentation got up a notch or two, and so are the graphics. While I love the sandbox and semi-open world aspects, I think the implementation feels artificial and ruins the immersion more often than not.
Sniper Ghost Warrior Contract 2 doesn't bring too many new things to the table, so it more of a safe rather than an evolutionary sequel. The sniping experience feels satisfying enough to keep you entertained for the entire campaign, and the way the maps are designed leaves room for different tactics. I think this a solid entry in the Sniper Ghost Warrior Contract series, but it's nothing revolutionary."

3652,196,Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2,75,Areajugones,"Jun  8, 2021","Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 doesn't revolutionize the stealth genre, but it doesn't have to: it's a game that knows its objectives and, because of that, manages to become a really fun adventure. Despite lacking a good story and having some noticeable technical flaws, it's one of the most enjoyable sniper and infiltration games that the industry has to offer."
3653,196,Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2,75,GRYOnline.pl,"Jun  8, 2021","Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 works well as a sniping game and a stealth FPP game with interesting maps.

However, CI Games almost seem afraid of letting the game shine, all too often moving you away from sniping, an action the game is named after. In addition, the game is showing a few issues, such as downright stupid AI and a few bugs here and there. It's a shame because there are good open areas to move around in, the contracts allow you to use your brain and plan the perfect hit and it all looks great while you're on your path to becoming the world's best blood-spatter creator."
3658,196,Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2,70,PC Invasion,"Jun 10, 2021","Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 still manages to offer a decent romp with its blend of stealth and action.

3660,196,Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2,70,GameMAG,"Jun  7, 2021","Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 is a rather simplistic game, aimed to the more casual audience. It can be a little frustrating, especially when there's too much enemies on screen, and when the pacing starts to drag on.

3661,196,Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2,65,Everyeye.it,"Jun  9, 2021","The core of the experience remains enjoyable and fun, as long as you take it more like a more of the same, if not almost an expansion of the first Contracts, and accept its obvious limitations and problems."
3662,196,Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2,60,Gfinity,"Jun 18, 2021","Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 feels like it dovetails with its predecessor nicely like an action movie double-bill. It's got new locations to explore, and long shot locations that add a degree of brainteasing to the otherwise standard-fare shooting, but overall it does what it sets out to do – it's a shooter for those that want to put holes in heads from miles away. And hey, maybe I'm one of those."
3663,196,Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2,60,IGN,"Jun 17, 2021","Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 blows off a heck of a lot of heads, but never managed to blow my mind. Its long range sniper shots feel genuinely satisfying to pull off, but the enemy AI is so dimwitted it almost seems cruel to kill them. With an upgrade system that’s largely skippable and mostly uninspired mission challenges, Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 is a competent sniper sim that lacks the edge required to be a real sharpshooter."
3664,196,Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2,60,NME,"Jun 16, 2021","Contracts 2 is, regrettably, a near miss that can’t be resolved with a quick follow-up shot. The run of the mill shooting drags the rest of the game down, and there’s so much of it it’s nearly impossible to overlook.vHowever, I’ve still enjoyed my time with the game and will be dipping back into the Long Shot contracts for a while to polish off some more of those challenges."
3665,197,The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes,90,GameCritics,"Oct 25, 2021","Supermassive Games is responsible for the most compelling interactive movies around, and House of Ashes proves that the Dark Pictures Anthology is on solid footing after a divisive second entry. While it shares the same basic structure of the previous two games — a mismatched group explores an abandoned location, discovering the secrets of what happened there — it’s so wildly different in tone and theme that it feels nothing like the others. This was a big swing in a few different ways, and I’m glad to say that they knocked it out of the park."
3666,197,The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes,90,Wccftech,"Oct 21, 2021","The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes is easily the best of the series so far. There are clear improvements in gameplay, such as difficulty options and complete control over the camera, which help push this forward. The writing also takes strides forward, with an excellent cast of characters, more realistic writing, and a satisfying narrative throughout. Add the already exceptional abilities of Supermassive Games at building atmosphere, and you have a recipe for a great game - something that I firmly believe House of Ashes is."
3667,197,The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes,85,Dexerto,"Oct 28, 2021","While House of Ashes lacks polish thanks to an off-putting 360-degree camera and inconsistent visuals, these are likely to be fixed in the future – it’s just a shame poor Ashley has been done a little bit dirty in the process (and that’s not because she’s covered in blood half the time). All in all, House of Ashes is the standout of the series so far, and if the increase in quality is anything to go by, Devil In Me is likely to be the best entry yet."

3671,197,The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes,80,TheGamer,"Oct 21, 2021","The best thing I can say about House of Ashes is that its story didn’t make me feel betrayed in the end. There is no “it was all a dream” twist that creates a dozen plot holes, and it doesn’t pull away from the supernatural elements at the last second to reveal that the characters were hallucinating. Rather, it uses its monsters to connect together its themes and create a closed loop that only the best horror stories can effectively execute. For once it feels like The Dark Pictures bit off exactly as much as it can chew, and House of Ashes is so much better off for it. This is where I would recommend newcomers start with the series, and it's a great indicator that the anthology is just going to keep getting better."

Fortunately, the hand-drawn textures might rope in a few people, and the sepia-esque colors stand out compared to other first-person adventure titles. Mundaun is technologically impotent but makes up for it with excellent atmosphere, sense of place, and storytelling. If you can see past its flaws, Mundaun is a wonderful, short adventure title."

3703,199,Mundaun,70,KeenGamer,"Mar 29, 2021","It's an inspired folk horror experience. Whilst it's a bit clunky in its mechanics surrounding combat, it’s still brimming with the surreal and the mythological and, above all, is presented with impeccable style and heart."
3704,199,Mundaun,70,Washington Post,"Mar 26, 2021",The game’s sketchbook aesthetic works favorably to conjure the impression of a Northern European folk tale and offset its rough-around-the-edges character.
3705,199,Mundaun,70,Edge Magazine,"Mar 25, 2021","Mundaun is both a densely imagined horror game and a story about a young man getting back in tune with the place of his birth.

3708,199,Mundaun,70,GamingBolt,"Mar 17, 2021","There's something here that horror enthusiasts will definitely enjoy, and even though it might not become one of your favourite horror experiences of all time, Mundaun is still a game that deserves your attention, at least for one playthrough."
3709,199,Mundaun,70,Hardcore Gamer,"Mar 16, 2021","Mundaun succeeds in taking a first-person adventure/horror game in a direction that feels unique. Games inspired by folklore and the blending of the supernatural and natural are nothing new, but Mundaun is able to execute this in an engaging manner through its storytelling and artistic direction. The lack of cluttering up the natural beauty of the game with quest markers and the like enhances the feelings of being alone in a strange land though people accustomed to such things may miss them. Mundaun is a game designed for those who wants to explore an area without their hand being held, and while the objective at hand may not always be clear, eventually finding and solving it does have a greater sense of satisfaction to it. The look and feel of Mundaun’s gameplay is reminiscent of older adventure games while still being relevant to contemporary gaming."

Despite that, it’s still a unique experience that offers a fresh approach to the horror genre."
3712,199,Mundaun,68,COGconnected,"Mar 16, 2021","If you don't mind being patient, however, Mundaun might be right up your alley.

If you don't mind some long walks through the mountains, there's a compelling story here, just waiting to be told."

The long passage of time is more a concern for the living than the dead, and hanging out with the ghosts of Cozy Grove is a lovely, chill way to unwind for a few minutes as one day flows into another."
3719,200,Cozy Grove,70,PC Games,"Apr 18, 2021","The waiting-mechanic restricts players and is frustrating at times, but simply changing the time of the system is an easy workaround, allowing for Cozy Grove to unfold its pleasant atmosphere and relaxing gameplay.

3720,200,Cozy Grove,70,Jeuxvideo.com,"Apr 15, 2021","Like Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Cozy Grove's leitmotif is to take your time, while taking advantage of breathtaking artistic direction.

3725,201,Disciples: Liberation,80,Screen Rant,"Oct 22, 2021","Disciples: Liberation is a fantastic experience. From the engaging story to the deep but approachable Strategy RPG combat, this is the type of game to suck players in until the wee hours of the morning. There aren't many games like Disciples: Liberation on the market these days, especially when the old champion, Might and Magic, has become an autobattler. Disciples: Liberation a welcome breath of fresh air that delivers hope for the future of the Strategy RPG genre."

The core ideas behind the gameplay are implemented well. Skills, units, battle mechanics, dialog choices are classy. On the other hand, the writing is juvenile and the low level of challenge can make the game feel tedious."
3731,201,Disciples: Liberation,70,PC Games,"Nov 17, 2021","Disciples: Liberation takes us on an epic adventure through a Dark Fantasy world that is filled with conflict and pain. The compelling narrative, characters and the tough decisions you have to make again and again to balance your standing in the four factions are what drives this game forward. The gameplay alone wouldn’t be able to motivate us for the 80 hour adventure, it is just to simple. The combat rarely presents a challenge and with the abundance of resources loses are easily replaced. We still had a lot of fun, since the roleplay aspect of the game works well enough."

3735,202,Backbone,100,Screen Rant,"Jun  7, 2021","Howard's journey ends far, far away from where it began and each step continuously develops the emotional investment for everyone in this world. While there are minor mechanical issues such as the ""interact"" input not always being immediately responsive, each element of Backbone is polished and expertly crafted. Backbone is a must-play GOTY contender that deserves every bit of mainstream recognition it receives, and exceeds the usual reach of its genre, making for a compelling experience that even those with little interest in point-and-click adventures will find difficult to put down."
3736,202,Backbone,90,God is a Geek,"Jun  7, 2021","Backbone features a compelling story and a well-realised post-noir dystopia, with engaging characters and some smart gameplay."
3737,202,Backbone,90,COGconnected,"Jun  7, 2021","Backbone tells an enormous story within a tiny runtime, and it never feels like too much. New wonders, new horrors, and fresh plot twists are chucked your way with reckless abandon. Yet, you never feel too lost. A little lost, surely! All the better to capture that sense of dark waters closing overhead. Between the clever mechanics, the compelling narrative, and the gorgeous pixel art, there's a real fire lit beneath you from the very start. If you're looking for a detective story with glistening fangs, glittering eyes, and sharpened hooks, Backbone will be perfect for you."
3738,202,Backbone,85,GameCritics,"Sep 14, 2021","Backbone’s narrative and character work are thrilling, complex, and thought-provoking, and the writing deserves all the praise it can get. That said, there is some feeling of the pacing being slightly off, since the final acts feel like they follow too quickly after the introductory ones. Whether it’s due to a lack of time or inspiration, the story could’ve done with at least two more chapters of narrative substance during the middle stretch. Any other issues I might raise with Backbone are mostly trivial. With its inspired script that accentuates themes of dystopia and desperation, this detective story delivers one of the most inspiring narrative-driven titles I’ve played in some time."
3739,202,Backbone,85,Softpedia,"Jun 29, 2021","Backbone is a good game that will disappoint some of its players. The world is engaging and the detective mechanics are limited but cool. A sequence at the end of Act III is one of the most stunning I have experienced in a video game, both from a narrative and presentation standpoint. The game also delivers on its tonal shift and twist and does things that a simple noir detective story could not. Backbone understands the value of good writing and works hard to make words matter. The development team has already said that it has more stories to tell in this universe and I very much want to see how they expand on the best elements of Backbone and how they can make the world even more intriguing."
3740,202,Backbone,80,Adventure Gamers,"Jun 21, 2021","Part noir thriller, part rumination on the human condition, and part ... something else, Backbone is stylish through and through, presenting more questions than answers but brimming with vibrantly realised characters."
3741,202,Backbone,80,Gfinity,"Jun 14, 2021","Backbone is a simple game to play, meaning that the dialogue and theme development had to carry the experience. While the narrative rushes to an uneasy finish, the story gives you a lot of meat to sink your teeth into."
3742,202,Backbone,80,Attack of the Fanboy,"Jun 10, 2021","Backbone does both, striking a balance between nostalgic and new, breathing another breath of life into the genre with its gritty, sad grin. This 2D, sidescrolling, pixel-art noir is a short but solid adventure mystery with stunning visuals and meaningful characters."
3743,202,Backbone,80,The Indie Game Website,"Jun  9, 2021","The ending left me with lots of questions, and I don’t invoke the names of Beckett and Kafka and Ballard lightly. I guess Lynch can go here too, as well as more modern writers like Atword, Ligotti, Butler, and Vandermeer: Backbone touches on the sort of existential uncertainty that these writers famously imbued their work with. It also made me think about the forces that push back against people’s herculean efforts to better their circumstances: be they inculcated beliefs from society, or perhaps even things that are more primordial than that. That’s perhaps the best praise I can give this game: that it’s going to sit festering in the back of my mind for a good long while."
3744,202,Backbone,80,Hardcore Gamer,"Jun  7, 2021","Even if it’s brief and falters during the third act, there’s no denying that Backbone is a truly gorgeous and captivating adventure, with an engrossing world that you’ll want to see even more of. It’s a unique mystery with a cast of amazing anthropomorphic animals that ends up going places players won’t expect, and it’s also one that’s likely worth revisiting after you’ve finished. There’s just a lot in here that truly excels in creating a unique twist on noir classics, and EggNut should pat themselves on the back for giving us another detective game that proves why many of them prefer to take the offbeat routes these days."
3745,202,Backbone,78,RPG Fan,"Jun 15, 2021","I walked away from Backbone puzzled about the ending, and in truth, I was a little disappointed. The game kind of squandered the excellent setup it spent hours developing, but because the setup is so good, I don’t feel totally let down. I still enjoyed my time in this dystopian Vancouver populated by animals, and I would almost certainly play a sequel if one were ever developed. But there’s the rub. Backbone feels like it needs a sequel. The story just doesn’t feel complete right now, and given that the game is pretty short (you can probably beat it in about 5-7 hours), it’s hard for me to enthusiastically recommend it. If you’re still interested despite the issues I’ve outlined, make sure you’re prepared for an abrupt conclusion. If you’re on the fence, well… maybe wait for a sale."
3746,202,Backbone,75,CD-Action,"Sep  1, 2021","Backbone has far fewer puzzles and stealth sections than you might expect after finishing the brilliant first act, but it will still keep you engaged thanks to the quality of its storytelling. [09/2021, p.40]"

3748,202,Backbone,75,Noisy Pixel,"Jun  7, 2021","Backbone dwells into the dark reality of a dystopian world full of corruption and injustice. Though the game has some gameplay issues and the story isn’t as long and well-paced as I had hoped, it brought a gorgeous cityscape with a comprehensive narrative. The dialogue is well-written, and the plot is greatly engaging, as it keeps you desiring to know what could happen next in the life of Howard Lotor."
3749,202,Backbone,73,KeenGamer,"Jun 28, 2021","Backbone seduces you into its world with its incredible style and characters. I was shocked by the game's first major twist and didn't want to stop playing. The writing is a highlight, and the music is dazzling. I was a bit let down to discover that my choices had little impact on the game's narrative, and the conclusion left me with more questions than answers. I don't know if a sequel is on the horizon, but Backbone is an overall interesting game worth checking out."
3750,202,Backbone,70,Edge Magazine,"Jul 17, 2021","This is a fine debut. Backbone uses its seductive looks to enrich a conceptually thoughtful and carefully plotted-out world, and delivers real surprises within a genre that is all about adhering to time-honoured conventions. [Issue#361, p.116]"
3751,202,Backbone,70,Eurogamer Italy,"Jul  5, 2021","Backbone is an interesting 2.5D side-scrolling, noir, pixel-art adventure set in a dystopic Vancouver. You are a raccoon detective in a world where everyone is an animal."
3752,202,Backbone,70,Critical Hit,"Jun 17, 2021","Backbone presents the player with an intriguinging world, populated by interesting characters that drive it’s often depressing and strange story home to what feels like an eventually inevitable conclusion. It’s just a pity that the minute-to-minute gameplay is not only uninspired, but it’s also rather boring."
3753,202,Backbone,70,Checkpoint Gaming,"Jun 13, 2021","Backbone is full of potential for greatness and makes a terrific first impression. With its compelling lead and supporting cast, and a fascinating setting full of tantalising lore and mysteries to solve, I spent most of my experience excited to find out where it was all leading. Unfortunately, much of the detective gameplay and plot start to come apart by the end, leading to an oddly inconclusive and unsatisfying conclusion."
3754,202,Backbone,70,GAMINGbible,"Jun 11, 2021","Backbone is a grim, unhappy tale that didn't sate any of my hunger for a good murder mystery. However, if you are looking for a deeply interesting world with complex and unsettling themes which will stick with you, I'd still recommend you give it a go."
3755,202,Backbone,70,Destructoid,"Jun  7, 2021","Backbone is stylish but not exceptional. It’s a good time with an enjoyable story, but otherwise it’s just kind of routine. The visual style is great, but it’s offset by uneven audio design. There’s definitely a lot to love about Backbone, I just don’t feel it sticks the landing quite well. It will be worthwhile playing for most, but I’m more interested in what comes next from EggNut."

3762,202,Backbone,60,Hey Poor Player,"Jul  2, 2021","Backbone gets off to a great start and it definitely has a lot to say. Great visuals and a stunning soundtrack made me want to give it the benefit of the doubt, to ignore its issues. As it goes on though, Backbone loses everything that made it interesting in its early hours. What replaces it is so different that its hardly even the same game. Different doesn’t have to mean bad, but the changes and ideas thrown around in the second half are too underdeveloped to overlook. Perhaps a sequel can allow the development team to further delve into its many themes. I liked enough of Backbone that for most of its running time I was enjoying myself. In its current state though, it’s hard to enthusiastically recommend."
3763,202,Backbone,60,Shacknews,"Jun 29, 2021","I am disappointed by the mixed feelings I get from Backbone. It is absolutely worth a look solely on the merits of its audiovisual presentation, but its attempt to offer commentary or insight into the topics its narrative broaches repeatedly fall flat, particularly in the latter half. EggNut clearly has the goods in the art and music departments, so I would love to see what they can do with a stronger narrative in the future. If you do choose to give Backbone a shot, make sure to get the Artifact Edition, as it includes the wonderful soundtrack. 6/10 otters in 3-piece suits."
3764,202,Backbone,60,New Game Network,"Jun 28, 2021","With amazing art and music, Backbone has a killer introduction and a great vibe. Unfortunately, due to a dreadful turn in the narrative and underdeveloped gameplay, this is a classic case of style over substance."
3765,202,Backbone,60,GameSpew,"Jun  8, 2021","Is Backbone worth a look? Yes, particularly if the idea of playing as an anthropomorphic animal appeals to you. There are times when it’ll have you on tenterhooks and there are several characters that are strong enough to stand out. It’s admirable that this was achieved on a small budget, but ultimately the developers have tried to cram too much in for Backbone to be truly successful."

3767,203,TOHU,80,Adventure Gamers,"Mar  1, 2021","TOHU serves up a charming little sci-fi narrative in a lovely cartoon style, but outside of one particularly egregious arcade sequence, its true strength is in its variety of interesting puzzles."
3768,203,TOHU,80,Digital Chumps,"Feb  8, 2021","TOHU reminded me of a lot of games that I played as a child, from the point and click design to the mini-game layout, I found myself feeling a bit nostalgic. This game is quite delightful if you don’t mind going at a slower pace and you have the patience to figure out some pretty difficult puzzles.

3770,203,TOHU,80,Hardcore Gamer,"Jan 26, 2021","Despite its narrative leading to little in the way of a noteworthy tale, TOHU manages to gracefully side-step such an omission through wise understanding of its scale. Utilizing such a wild, excessive aesthetic in a way that feels earned, as opposed to unjustly forced. But in focusing specifically on the bevvy of point-and-click conundrums — as much making sure to sprinkle in more deductive puzzles along the way — TOHU isn’t just a pleasant trip through a child-like exaggeration of visuals and scenery, but crucially, does so in a way that doesn’t treat its players similarly as such young-aged audience members. Both with the way conundrums are presented, but also through its hint system that manages to give enough of an assistance, yet still trust its players to deduce the correct method forward. It may fall victim to the trappings of point-and-click’s very structure once or twice along the way, but TOHU still manages to provide a short and sweet little adventure through a surreal, at times delightful, set of circumstances."

It may have elevated my blood pressure for the few hours I spent with it, but I don’t regret the shortening of my lifespan in the slightest. If you gave this short but sweet little gem one glance and immediately thought fondly of Machinarium, I don’t have to tell you twice that TOHU was made for you.

The game looks great (the hand-drawn environments are wonderful!) but is much to infantile for my taste (especially the dialogues) and not creative enough in the puzzles department, while the awful narrator does a lot to destroy the atmosphere.

3774,203,TOHU,55,Hooked Gamers,"Mar 29, 2021","TOHU isn’t the best point-and-click out there. The confusing story and tedious puzzle solving leave a lot to be desired. Point-and-click adventure games of this style live in a weird place today. This one seems to take inspiration from Humongous Games’ portfolio and it is just too hard to live up to the nostalgia of playing games like Pajama Sam as a child. The art and interactions in that game are unforgettable and the story was fun and educational. TOHU starts going down this path and succeeds in some of that world building and light-hearted story telling, but it barely even scratches the surface compared to what already exists."

Before We Leave makes logistics an easy, streamlined process through an intuitive UI and readability across its design. The fun lays in ironing out the kinks in your immense system and achieving a sustainable economy, all to overcome impending doom. While there is some underlying mundanity, the overwhelming joy and optimism the game extrudes from the player cannot be understated.

Its low-key nature and philosophy make it great for those who feel overwhelmed by the laundry list of responsibilities of 4X-style management and development. The design is sound, the presentation is fantastic and I’m a huge fan of the hex-gridded world map represented as a 3D globe. The individual models of the Peeps and their architecture are so charming, and the soothing soundtrack that plays when running the time at max speed is really nice. There are areas of the game that feel a little rough around the edges but the updates show a commitment by the developer to bring in the right amount of polish that’ll lead it toward greater heights of inventive fun."

The gripes noted herein are all present in an alpha build, so it's possible that Balancing Monkey already addressed these and other concerns between then and now. If not, though, the subtle makings of a personality may not be able to atone for the fact that its mysterious, mellow tone is undermined by frequent annoyances."

Just that the experience would have been complete with just a little more icing on the cake. Greak is a fairly affordable game on Steam also, so if you’re in the market for a game like Ori without the price tag before sales.

3805,205,Greak: Memories of Azur,50,Slant Magazine,"Aug 13, 2021","By himself, Greak feels like a dull carbon copy of so many protagonists from recent action-exploration games, namely Hollow Knight. Having Adara and Raydel eventually accompany him, so that you’re simultaneously controlling three characters, adds a superficially more creative, if awkward, layer to the game, a multi-character gimmick that Greak never fully utilizes. But the puzzles tend toward the rote, as in one character needing to hold down a pressure plate or crank open a door to facilitate the path forward for everyone in the group."

This is a fatal flaw in a game with gated progression, and there are no supplementary modes or other features to distract from it. As it stands, the game's mix of mobile mechanics makes its release on traditional platforms baffling, and only those who are immediately intrigued by Ziggs in a game outside of League of Legends will get something substantial out of the final product in its current available forms."

Who would have thought an open world game of this nature could be distilled into an isometric platformer with great combat? As far as experiments go, this is one of Ubisoft’s stranger ones. And I really hope its a sign of things to come. Personally, I probably won’t ever reach a point of fatigue with open world games. They are easy to get lost in or put down for a long period of time and come right back to. The Lost Gods isn’t short by any means but it’s also unique enough that it may act as proof that new genres and new IPs can amount to something special for the publisher. I truly believe Fenyx will be back in all her godly might."

3861,210,Gamedec,70,Hey Poor Player,"Sep 23, 2021","Gamedec seems to show exactly how far you can pare down a cRPG, stripping away some of the deeper mechanics to streamline a tabletop-inspired experience. Those new to the genre will enjoy this opportunity to get their feet wet, while established veterans will feel this virtual “one-shot” campaign was executed succinctly. If you love cyberpunk detective stories and want something that will absolutely suck you in for 10 – 20 hours, you can’t go wrong with Gamedec."
3862,210,Gamedec,70,COGconnected,"Sep 17, 2021","Gamedec has a lot of interesting ideas and mechanics, and its hardboiled- detective-in-the-22nd-century story is a great premise. Either the developers had ambitions beyond their ability to deliver, or maybe the game just needs a few more passes with the random orbital sander to smooth down the rough edges, but in its present state Gamedec’s flaws definitely detract from an otherwise intriguing experience."

Up until then the investigations are mysterious and fun, telling a legitimately interesting tale. After it the game feels like it goes into hyperdrive, not stopping until the credits roll. If this universe is ever revisited, I would hope there would be more investigative stories and less weird color-coded mazes. As it stands then, Gamedec is best described as a promising title with uneven execution."

3867,210,Gamedec,62,Game World Navigator Magazine,"Nov 30, 2021","Gamedec’s modest skill tree not only feels tacked on – it actively hampers the role-playing aspect, because certain dialogue options reward you with leveling points, and others don’t. So there’s a strong incentive to just sift through dialogue looking for those special options, instead of doing what feels natural for the character. [Issue#256, p.52]"
3868,210,Gamedec,60,RPGamer,"Nov  5, 2021","Gamedec certainly doesn’t lack ambition. Its setting is well thought-out and provides a rich tapestry to fall back on when the player’s actual interactions with the world come up a little wanting. While its aesthetics are great, a bit more attention was needed in the audio department, as music is generally only adequate and there are entire sections devoid of music altogether. Voice-overs are likewise notably absent. The all-important investigations struggle to gel during the game’s first half, and while the narrative eventually picks up a bit more, it’s clear there were some missed opportunities here. Overall, Gamedec presents a rich world that would be worth revisiting again, though perhaps with an extra layer of polish needed for its narrative."

It may be that the world is so complex and filled with so much grey within the black and white that games struggle with adding in the tiny touches that make Cyberpunk worlds really come alive. Gamedec has the lore, but it doesn’t go that extra step further to really incorporate it into the world. Gamedec doesn’t seem to know the benefits of the phrase “less is more” and instead of trusting in the beauty of the world it created, stuck its fingers into too many narrative pies. What is left is a pie full of so many ingredients that it’s hard to tell what the flavour of it actually is; it’s tasty and looks good, but you may be too full to go back for seconds."

Sledgehammer has always helped drive the franchise forward into adventurous new territories and Vanguard is no exception. If you find yourself itching for a new FPS in your life, Vanguard is ready for you to pick up and is easy enough to drop into so that you’ll never feel out of place as a new player. If you’re wary about picking this game up because you’re someone who didn’t like the change from 2019 Modern Warfare’s engine to Treyarch’s in Cold War, then you’ll be happy to learn that this runs on Modern Warfare’s engine and the gunplay and visuals remain entirely intact."
3877,211,Call of Duty: Vanguard,90,Forbes,"Nov 12, 2021","All told, Call Of Duty: Vanguard has exceeded my expectations, especially after a less-than-promising pre-launch Alpha and press event. Then again, the Beta was drastically improved overall so I was already feeling more optimistic by launch. I’m also very excited for post-launch content like Shipment, League and Gunfight, as well as more MP and Zombies maps. Now that maps are always free—replaced by a Battle Pass and cosmetic Item Shop—these games stay fresh and populated much longer than before, and I foresee a great deal of Vanguard in my future, though I’m sure I’ll dip back into Cold War frequently as well."
3878,211,Call of Duty: Vanguard,90,GamingTrend,"Nov  4, 2021","War never changes, and Call Of Duty is in fact still Call Of Duty. Sledgehammer Games however has happened across an intriguing formula, connecting what has worked in previous games and integrating it into their own. The campaign is stunning, and while short lived has a ton of heart, Zombies is as fun and maybe more inviting than it’s ever been, and the multiplayer hard carries this entry to a round 11 victory. This culmination of all things Call Of Duty has resulted in something the entire series can look to, a blueprint on how to build a meaty and superb first person shooter experience."

There’s nothing overly surprising here, no major shakeups to the gameplay, nothing that rejuvenates the franchise like 2007’s Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. But that doesn’t mean it’s bad. In fact, Call of Duty: Vanguard offers a solid experience for those looking for their annual fix from the franchise. The campaign packs a punch and even manages to hit some emotional highs without dragging out longer than it has to. For Zombies fans, this will likely be a disappointing entry in the series, at least at launch. As for the multiplayer, it hits the Call of Duty gold standard of tight, fast-paced combat that players have come to expect. For those that dig the series, this one nails the Call of Duty experience."
3882,211,Call of Duty: Vanguard,80,The Games Machine,"Nov  8, 2021","Call of Duty: Vanguard clears the bar thanks to its convincing multiplayer, rich in content and with some new features such as the Battle Rhythm and wider environmental destruction, which reinforce an already solid gameplay. There is no innovation or revolution for the franchise, and those who have played the most recent games in the series already know what awaits them, but perhaps the secret of its commercial success will be precisely this."

It’s a worthy purchase if you’re into the franchise, or just want a shooter to play with your pals, and the visuals are absolutely top-notch, but it does really feel like a filler year until we get the rumoured Modern Warfare 2 in 2022."
3884,211,Call of Duty: Vanguard,80,PC Games,"Nov  4, 2021","Call of Duty: Vanguard brings the franchise back to the roots. Not only because of the world war 2 setting, also because of the slower gameplay in comparison with a lot of other games of the franchise. The short, action-packed campaign is fun to play and the story of the historic inspired main characters is captivating. The multiplayer has a good balance, a neat pacing and offers with sixteen 6vs6 maps a good change. The Zombies mode is unfortunately the big weakness of Vanguard. It’s fun to play, but still missing a lot of content like the story and the popular Easter eggs."

If you’re most invested in the single-player experience, you can pass on this year’s entry, but if you’re into the other modes, Call of Duty remains an excellent choice for some shooting, looting, and zombie executing."

3888,211,Call of Duty: Vanguard,75,Worth Playing,"Nov 16, 2021","Call of Duty: Vanguard drops the ball on two fronts. The campaign is a short, disjointed, and shallow affair, and its Zombies mode is solid but too bare-bones and devoid of content to recommend at the moment. Regular multiplayer matches are where Vanguard shines the brightest, but a lot of that is due to leaning heavily into familiar territory. Vanguard struggles to make meaningful additions to the formula, and apart from new battle pacing options and a generous selection of maps, Vanguard sits comfortably on the achievements of its predecessors. That's not a bad thing, and I enjoyed the online components throughout this review, but it's also not a great look for a yearly release. If you haven't played a Call of Duty title in a few years and don't care for its single-player campaign, Vanguard is a fun and solid entry in the series."

The weapons are well thought out with a configuration that is not unpleasant after reflection. The balancing is not bad and the TTK is really satisfying. The Campaign mode and the Zombie mode are unfortunately the black spots. The Zombie mode seems unfinished and the Campaign mode could have had a few more hours to dig a little deeper into the story of Vanguard.

If you're an avid Call of Duty fan, Vanguard may still be strong enough to hold your interest, but if you've grown skeptical over the years, it isn't likely to bring you back into the fray."

What’s worse is that as the story progresses and we learn more about the world and the origins of the living produce, a lot of darker questions begin to surface but none of them are really answered.

I like its atmosphere and the glee it takes in letting you be evil, but if I wasn't reviewing it, I probably would've dropped Rogue Lords after the first hour. There's fun to be had here if you can push through it, but like a lot of Eurojank games, it doesn't feel like it's entirely finished."
3931,213,Rogue Lords,50,Screen Rant,"Oct 12, 2021","The terror and hindrance effects make each run feel uniquely challenging, and the story events and Disciple traits are where Rogue Lords really shines. Unfortunately, as it stands, Rogue Lords suffers significantly from its lack of balance and the repetitive nature of both runs and combat. It can be difficult to strategize when RNG constantly feels stacked against the player, and being forced to restart a book after a surprise, impossible boss fight is demoralizing. With some retuning, however, Rogue Lords could better capitalize on its great ideas and innovate for the roguelike genre."
3932,213,Rogue Lords,45,GamingTrend,"Oct 11, 2021","Rogue Lords is a fine game with some novel systems for lovers of roguelites to play around with, but it will not grab your attention long enough to keep you coming back. Given its premise and stellar art design, that’s a shame."
3933,214,Mighty Goose,85,Noisy Pixel,"Jun  4, 2021","Mighty Goose is a guns-blazing run-and-gunner that wears its Metal Slug inspiration on its sleeve. With hectic combat and a colorful design, it’s a fun action experience that knows how to use its comedy vein well. If you’ve ever felt the need to play as a powerful space goose, your prayers have been answered."
3934,214,Mighty Goose,80,Softpedia,"Jun 22, 2021","Mighty Goose is a very good experience for a clearly defined set of players. One needs to love old-school arcade action to love it. An interest in wacky characters helps, as does a focus on gameplay and an interest in trying to best one’s old scores. The game knows what it can deliver and offers a very pure experience for those who know what they want from it. The problem is that the developers do not push the limits of the space they settled in. The companions and the special powers are attempts at this but limited ones. After three or four levels even the idea of battling new bosses failed to excite me about the game. Mighty Goose is another title that needs more than very good execution of core concepts to stand out."
3935,214,Mighty Goose,80,PC Invasion,"Jun  4, 2021","Mighty Goose is a damn good game that neatly scratches the run-and-gun itch, all while keeping things moving with strong level design, zany action, and tight gameplay. If that’s up your alley, I’d recommend trying it out."
3936,214,Mighty Goose,75,CD-Action,"Jul 23, 2021","A love letter to Contra, Metal Slug and the likes, Mighty Goose does a really good job at recreating the look and feel of classic side-scrolling run-and-gun games. Of course, high difficulty level comes with the territory, but for me combat plunges into confusing chaos too often (“wait, is this an enemy bullet or just a harmless visual effect?”), somewhat spoiling the fun alongside the unfriendly autosave system.

There’s no poetic justice to be meted out, no truly dastardly plot to raze the universe to the ground, and no tearjerker or heroic moments: just the opportunity to enact scenes of pure, exhilarating carnage."
3938,214,Mighty Goose,75,Gaming Age,"Jun  7, 2021","Maybe I have a soft spot for short geese games and this one is definitely short. I wish there was a little bit more story and maybe dial back on the Metal Slug homages. The game has some unique features, but they never seem fully fleshed out and useful. Otherwise this is a completely serviceable shoot ’em up that fans of Metal Slug will surely get a kick out of."
3939,214,Mighty Goose,30,Screen Rant,"Jun  4, 2021","Though there is plentiful evidence here of worthy inspirations which should feed into a fun run ’n’ gun experience, the finished product fails to deliver. There’s style and pizazz on offer, but even an assortment of unlockable abilities and AI-controlled companions can’t enliven a game which feels this flat and underdeveloped. Mighty Goose is sure to move a few units based on its visuals alone, but they’ll be little comfort when no one can tell what’s happening on the screen."

Instead of pleasing the mainstream tastes, the Japanese have created games that require you to master available techniques and are brutally difficult even if you do. Most players will find them much to hard to complete, but that’s why we love these team Ninja’s masterpieces, right? [09/2021, p.36]"
3941,215,Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection,80,Gamer Escape,"Jun  9, 2021","Still sporting tough as nails gameplay and brimming with the fast-paced ninja action the series is known for, picking up the Ninja Gaiden Ultimate Collection is a safe recommendation based on the strength of the first two titles alone. Ninja Gaiden 3 may still be the low point in this trilogy, but that shouldn’t deter those new to the series to give Sigma and Sigma 2 a fair shake. Both of those games still withstand the test of time, and in the case of the Switch version is something fun to play portably as well. In the grand scheme of remakes and ports, you could do a lot worse than these three games. If Team Ninja finally decides to work on a fourth entry in the series, I’m hoping those who end up devouring this collection will be well rewarded."

The Master Collection is also priced fairly at $40, but it’s too bad that these games did not get more love on this release — the Master Collection is about as barebones as you can get for a compilation release. Still, if this is maybe an indication that the door to a whole new NG adventure is forthcoming, one that embraces the design of the first two, then that’s great news. Anyway — speculation aside — if you’re looking to relive these games or want to get into the franchise for the first time, this is very good way to do it."

I still had a great time revisiting them, and my only real criticism is that Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 was a poor pick in a world where Ninja Gaiden 2 exists. It’s a shame that more of an effort wasn’t made to jazz these up, but it’s still great that the classics are finally on PC."

Despite the years, the trilogy remains an excellent vintage made up of two wonderful experiences and a spectacular third title. However, keep in mind that this new compilation brings nothing new other than the addition of the sacrosanct 4K / 60fps on PlayStation 4 Pro, PlayStation 5, Xbox One X and Xbox Series X and S. Three excellent games therefore, which are unfortunately grouped together in a compilation which is satisfied with the minimum union. Now that you are warned, it is up to you to decide whether or not to take out the katana or not to pour out gallons and gallons of hemoglobin."

Awful camera, lack of target lock-on and, at times, unfair difficulty makes this whole experience a chore. If you do not have strong nostalgia for them or are not a die-hard fan of action games, you will not miss a lot by skipping it. You would be better off playing Nioh 1 & 2, which distilled some good elements of NG resulting in a couple of vastly superior games."

I genuinely enjoyed every moment I spent with it — even when stuck — because it was such a joy to look at and explore. There were a few times I got stuck, certainly, but nothing that kept me from progressing for too long. If you like point and click games with good puzzles, great depth, and an incredibly unique story with fun characters, your quest for Mutropolis ends here."

3958,216,Mutropolis,70,GamingTrend,"Feb 18, 2021","Mutropolis is a fun game held back by unforgiving speed bumps. I am enthralled by the beautiful art style, and the tone the game sets in the narrative leaves you having a good time. But it’s hard to enjoy what you’re doing if you can’t move forward, and I too often found myself at a stop sign."

Watching Mutropolis as I might an Adult Swim cartoon, I was able to appreciate it as a solid comedic work without having to suffer through trying to independently work through its puzzles."
3961,216,Mutropolis,60,Digital Chumps,"Feb 26, 2021","Overall, Metropolis has the bones to be a great game, however, the slow pace, lack of instruction, and lengthy dialogue made it frustrating to play. While the interactions, visuals, and storyline are amazing the gameplay and mechanics were lacking. If there were more instructions or hints this game would have been a home run. If problem-solving is your jam, then this game is perfect for you. However, if you don’t like having to figure out every small detail of a game, then you should probably skip this game for now."

Its unique and interesting gimmick allows it to reach places that other indie games have yet to travel, although it does fall into limitations with just how engaging it can be thanks to its pacing and self-inflicted restrictive nature. Nonetheless, fans of character-centric experimental works will likely want to give this a go, and it's a useful blueprint for potential future innovation, too."
3969,217,The Longest Road on Earth,60,The Indie Game Website,"May 27, 2021","Where other games insist on non-stop explosions and chase scenes, The Longest Road on Earth calibrates each moment to be poignant and profound, and although the results are quieter and artsier, they also aren’t much less exhausting. And yet, emotional exhaustion seems as viable of a takeaway as any. After all, the small things we use to get through our days, to cope with the perpetual thrum of unexcitement in lives lived conservatively, do eventually fade into routine. We grow tired of the phone game we bought or that playlist we made and we find ourselves ready for the next thing, which tends to be similarly fleeting. By the time the credits roll for The Longest Road on Earth, I was more than ready to move on, but maybe that doesn’t have to be a criticism because it speaks to its own sort of emotional truth."

The puzzles are engaging and never too simple to solve, but they are also not so difficult they become frustrating. Operation: Tango forces players to find new ways of communicating, often leading to humorous quips and miscommunications. For what it is, Operation: Tango is snappy, clever, well-designed, and incredibly engaging. Fans of co-op puzzlers should consider trying their hand at this high-tech espionage."
3972,218,Operation: Tango,80,Multiplayer.it,"May 26, 2021","Operation Tango is a great cooperative experience. This ""spy simulator"" basically offers two games in one and thus manages to make up for the limited number of missions and low longevity."

The game, with its mastered asymmetric gameplay, simply offers two totally different and yet complementary ways to play. Unfortunately, the proposal, while short, runs out of steam somewhat over time, repeatedly featuring the same mini-games or introducing increasingly confusing objectives. Despite its small flaws, the little creation deserves your full attention, especially if you are looking for an experience to punctuate one or two evenings of your summer vacation."

3978,218,Operation: Tango,60,Eurogamer Italy,"May 31, 2021","Operation: Tango is a challenging spy adventure that will keep you entertained for a few hours. The title of Clever Plays, however, fails to materialize in a thick product, remaining a rather light and undemanding work."
3979,218,Operation: Tango,60,Checkpoint Gaming,"May 29, 2021","Operation Tango gets the look and feel of being a secret agent team absolutely right, with a cool soundtrack to boot. But it’s held back by its hit-and-miss gameplay, which can range from super cool to frustrating. A longer campaign may have let the gameplay expand and deepen, but with only 6 short missions and little replay value, it ends up feeling a little shallow. The upside is, this makes the game a perfect candidate for some DLC."

It wears its inspirations on its sleeve and doesn’t shatter the genre’s conventions with innovative ideas, but still finds enough sure footing to set itself apart from its contemporaries. Moreover, an unsurprising story and a few instances of intentional time-wasters in puzzles aren’t enough to lessen the benefits of its brisk pace and variety of gorgeous environments. It may not hit the highest highs of the genre, but if you’re in the mood for an atmospheric puzzle platformer, you could do much worse."

3992,219,Scarf,70,Finger Guns,"Jan  5, 2022","While it’s not pushing the genre any further forward, Scarf is a perfectly pleasant way to spend 6 hours of your life. As a non-combative puzzle platformer, it lacks originality. Thankfully, a clever two sided narrative carries the game as it tells both sides of a tale and positions the player in the centre. Just make sure you play this game with a guide so you don’t have to replay whole levels again."
3993,219,Scarf,70,The Indie Game Website,"Dec 20, 2021","As a platformer, Scarf doesn’t particularly break new ground, and veterans of the genre will hardly pause for thought when solving its puzzles. That makes it liable to be written off as ‘just another platformer‘, which is a real shame. A full playthrough of the game can be comfortably achieved in one sitting, and the valuable message that lies at the heart of its narrative is more than worth taking the time. Scarf isn’t designed to challenge or frustrate, but provides the player with the satisfaction of puzzle-solving and a gently introspective allegorical tale."

It drips the atmosphere of ancient China and offers a great combat system, but also doesn’t shy away from spells and well-implemented parkour. However, said combat system along with the game’s fast pace sets the bar rather high for newcomers. [11/2021, p.47]"

No two rounds feel the same, and yet the familiarity of each one makes it easy to keep coming back for more. It’s not perfect, by any means, with its combat system offering a breath of fresh air but also leading to moments of frustration.

Its refreshing approach to the Battle Royale genre will convince the bravest, while the less patient will probably not have the temerity to go beyond a few hours. When we see the game design choices made by 24 Entertainment, we can only salute the nerve. It is therefore all the more regrettable to face a monetization unworthy of a paid game, present at all levels, and which will ultimately reward relatively little those who decide to really get involved."

But the focus almost entirely on close quarters fighting can grow repetitive and frustrating, too, especially against the much better players that seem to dominate the space. Although it pushes microtransactions past the point of annoyance, they don’t radically impact the game, which is ultimately much more skill-based than that of other games in the genre."

However the game's longevity suffers due to becoming stale quickly, the lack of variance in the core gameplay loop rearing its ugly head quickly. It's the kind of game I would absolutely recommend to a friend, but only for one or two matches at a time. For long marathon sessions, there are far better options."

The latter is also a success in every way, whether in terms of sets, chara design or animation. A colorful dreamlike epic galvanized by Johannes Johansson's musical composition. Unfortunately if the visual is inspired and inspiring, it just lacks a dose of challenge and innovation in the gameplay to make the platform unforgettable. Two elements that can only be found in the conclusion of the work, enough to leave regrets."

The platforming can be a little clunky and the game may not challenge seasoned gamers.

It’s also pretty funny how often you get Steam achievements—within the first few minutes of starting the game, you get three achievements including one for literally starting the game and another for moving to the next area (Steam achievements, of course, mean nothing). It’s a nice way to pass the time if you want a relatively stress-free platformer that’s easy on the eyes, but even as Hoa demands little from you as a player, it also offers little as an escape."

In addition, the game also sins with some unfortunate choices regarding inventory management, the resource collection loop or the durability of equipment, too ephemeral. With a shift in tone at the midpoint, which relegates survival to the closet, the Breathedge experience is not always balanced, despite some real good ideas and a story that follows without displeasure, for a little one. about twenty hours."

If you enjoy puzzle platformers and don’t mind some truly haunting imagery, I’d definitely give it a shot.

The wonderful art direction, cinematography, animation (for the most part) and other elements do come together to create a cohesive and visually surprising journey. There’s variety here, quite a bit of it considering the very short runtime. So even though it doesn’t quite emerge, fully formed, from the shadows of Limbo, Abe’s Odyssey, or Another World, White Shadows certainly makes its mark. However fleeting that might be."

Yet for how little it attempts to break from tired conventions or do anything that doesn’t border on aggravating with its pacing, it’s what the game doesn’t do where most of one’s response will likely linger. Maybe the conclusion that it’s all too ordinary and forgettable is bizarrely what is most poignant. That little is offered in the other direction that’s in anyway damaging to the experience or worthy of ridicule, yet neither does anything warrant an expression any better than a figurative shrugging of the shoulders. In the end White Shadows, in all its many off-kilter interspersing of music pieces, plays things safe.

It set out to be a slice of small-town life, and that’s what it is. I think there’s a rather narrow audience for that kind of thing, but it will be perfect for those who know what they’re getting into. If you think you’d be into a narrative about escaping the city life, then here it is. The writing is solid, the production values are decent for its asking price, so it’s worthwhile to check out of that’s your thing. As for me, I’m just eager to get back to the city."

No choice is better than the other, which means that the title really lets us choose what we want, without it having a positive or negative impact on the gaming experience. The sublime artistic direction, the incredible landscapes, and the chill soundtrack are a perfect setting for such a reflection. Lake could almost be reimbursed by social security because its soothing virtues are numerous. Unfortunately, a few bugs tarnish the picture, while we admit to having trouble releasing the 20 € requested for 6 hours of play, with very low replayability. In short, hop on Lake in a few months, after a few patches, and during a promo."

But you'll wish its flashes of understated majesty and its softly spoken introspective exchanges weren't compromised by performance that's woefully inconsistent. But if Gamious manages to patch this into a steadier experience, you can add a point, or even two, to the score below. Because there's something special here, beneath the creaks and the cracks."

4083,225,Lake,70,Noisy Pixel,"Sep  3, 2021","Does Lake push the boundaries and redefine the genre of a narrative adventure? I wouldn’t say so, but I would contend that it’s a welcome addition. The game is a great exploration of the impact one can have on others’ lives with simple interactions in a peaceful manner. There are quality-of-life issues, and the impact may not be as great as you would hope. In fact, there’s nothing grandiose about the game, but that works in its favor–it’s a calming presence in a world of chaos."

The interactive story shaped by Gamious also benefits from a great deal of authenticity and choice of dialogues that allow the player to feel truly engaged. Too bad the adventure is based on a pattern that does not evolve enough, a too languid pace and a scenario that fails to touch us fully."

4086,225,Lake,60,Worth Playing,"Sep  1, 2021","In the end, Lake delivers on producing a ""slice of life"" experience but with some issues that keep it from being excellent. The characters are interesting to talk to, even if only a few of them break out from being one-dimensional. The vocal performances are good, but the stiff facial and body animations and rushed story don't give it a chance to connect with players. If you can forgive these shortcomings and don't find the mail delivery mechanic to be tedious, Lake is relaxing and different enough from other offerings to warrant a glance."
4087,225,Lake,60,Screen Rant,"Aug 31, 2021","Lake tells a beautiful story, has nuanced and interesting characters, and has an environment that feels comforting and inviting. What detracts from the experience is, unfortunately, the game's tedious tasks and slow pace. This combination makes it hard to leave the experience with a clear opinion about the time spent in Providence Oaks, but what is clear is that Lake will absolutely satisfy players who feel like they need to escape and spend some time taking it slow and easy."

This setting would have been perfect for misadventures of Alan Wake, a mystical thriller or a murder mystery, but Lake is different. It’s very grounded, true-to-life, sterile and a bit janky, a primitive middle ground between Bus Simulator and Death Stranding."

While it doesn’t always do everything well or necessarily telegraph its harder ideas ahead of time, it can be a tense thrill when you get further than you have before. Never before have dice been featured in a game where they’re the biggest thing that matters. If you like rolling dice then I compel you to check out this mash up. Just be ready for the challenge ahead of you."

4093,226,Dice Legacy,76,Gamers' Temple,"Oct 12, 2021","Overall, Dice Legacy is enjoyable as long as you enjoy a challenge. It has an unusual mix of gameplay that sets it apart from other games of this type. While the dice and some of your decisions add a random element to the game, it feels like Dice Legacy does have an idea of how it wants you to play the game. You don’t necessarily have the freedom to try a variety of strategies, if you want to succeed, that is. Perhaps that’s what makes it more of a survival game and less of a strategy game."

Even if the first rounds went rather suboptimally and frustration quickly arose, I gave the game more time. Lo and behold, after a while you understand the individual mechanics and appreciate them. But the countless waves of opponents later in the game bothered me immensely. You always have to have a soldier's die ready to fend off them. It feels like the next wave comes after every defense.

Finally, the fact that its lifespan is based only on more difficult variants of the same story may quickly tire players, since it does not offer other maps, nor varied scenarios, nor easy access to the dices from previous games."

4104,226,Dice Legacy,50,GameSkinny,"Sep 10, 2021","Dice Legacy is just too shallow and too reminiscent of other, better games. It's just far too simplistic to have any kind of real replayability, and since your first playthrough will be done in four or five hours at most, that leaves little to play for. Sure, the game does try to extend its replay value by offering different starting conditions and rule restrictions to try to get you to play it again, but it's the same meta every time with no real variation. There's no shortage of good roguelikes out there. Crack those open instead. You'll have a lot more fun that way."

With an incredibly high standard of voice talent on board, sublime art direction and an outstanding soundtrack, it sets a new standard for interactive narration. This is more than a video game, it’s a work of art. And once you’ve played it, it’s one you won’t be forgetting about in a hurry."

Though the story takes risks, it manages to rein them in a bit, as not to drown its players in metaphor, something the team once seemed happy to do in 2016. Questions go unanswered and some mysteries are once again meant to idle in the player's mind, but in all, Last Stop is more popcorny than I expected but no less entertaining."

It’s more of an interactive movie than a game in a strict sense. The story is more than solid and fun to follow, but you have no influence on it, and many will find pushing some buttons on a controller from time to time not engaging enough. [10/2021, p.48]"

4117,227,Last Stop,70,Checkpoint Gaming,"Jul 25, 2021","Though it may alienate some players due to its lack of gameplay, Last Stop has an action-packed narrative that doesn’t get stale. It beautifully juxtaposes the mundane day-to-day life of three characters against a bizarre science-fiction story. The fantastic voice talent brings a level of charisma and life that unfortunately isn’t matched by the rather stiff in-game animations, although that doesn’t stop the game from being a fun tube ride through an alien-infested London where weird stuff happens to pretty ordinary people."
4118,227,Last Stop,70,Hardcore Gamer,"Jul 22, 2021","Last Stop may succeed when it comes to delivering a (mostly) engrossing set of stories, but it suffers from a notable lack of substance when it comes to gameplay, with several moments of interactivity feeling like they were included solely only to draw things out. It can still be a fun ride with a lot of enjoyable twists and turns, and could be recommended for fans of narrative-focused games, but it could have benefited from more depth. Last Stop is a good, straight shot of a subway ride that gets you to your destination, but don’t expect much beyond that."

It provided three distinct stories that were surprisingly deep considering it only took about six hours to tell them all and allowed players to feel like they were in control even if that might not have always been the case. I never felt like my time was wasted in Last Stop, but if the game ever gets a follow-up, it’ll have to be more polished with some meaningful changes to warrant a return to its stories."

4125,227,Last Stop,65,Noisy Pixel,"Aug 11, 2021","Last Stop serves up a strong narrative, mixing existentialism with the lives of ordinary people, but it forgets to be a game at some points. The interaction and story bits keep you invested at the cost of choices and navigation segments that do nothing for the adventure. At its best, Last Stop should be enjoyed as a casual narrative-focused experience, but asking anything more of it may have you exiting before the end of the line."

Precise rhythm, convincing characters, story that keeps us in suspense: there is no doubt that the Variable State studio masters its pen.

At its best it's an enjoyable and immersive narrative adventure game, and Paper Dolls is definitely a good enough story strand to have carried the game on its own had it been expanded. However, the different quality of its three stories, and the awkward narrative shift in its final chapter, does mean that Last Stop feels a little like a missed opportunity when all is said and done, and a good game that could've been excellent with just a bit more content and some tighter scripts."
4130,227,Last Stop,60,Twinfinite,"Jul 21, 2021","When it comes down to it, Last Stop is an entertaining journey that just goes completely off the rails in its final half, failing to execute on the interesting ideas it comes up with at the start. I know that endings shouldn’t take away from the ride, but when you’re playing a title that is almost completely narrative and character-driven, I just couldn’t help but feel a letdown when credits rolled."

4134,228,Maquette,80,GameCritics,"Mar 31, 2021","For anyone who has ever fallen in love or suffered heartbreak, Maquette will resonate. Yes, some puzzles were weaker than others, but those issues felt secondary to the masterful tapestry being painted before my eyes. Maquette is a poignant and rewarding experience that reminded me of some of my happiest moments, it forced me to stare straight at sorrow, and simultaneously reassured me that it’s okay to feel that pain."
4135,228,Maquette,80,Worth Playing,"Mar 12, 2021","Maquette is well worth experiencing. The use of recursive puzzles is fresh because so few games use it, and even though you can stumble upon the solution to some puzzles, most of them feel clever — even if they're relatively simple. The game does a great job of setting the player in a dreamlike state, and the story may be simple and lack details, but it still feels relatable. Maquette works perfectly as a palate cleanser for bigger and heavier games."
4136,228,Maquette,80,Guardian,"Mar  7, 2021","In its juxtaposition of abstract puzzles with domestic-scale storytelling, Maquette is more familiar, following the tradition of indie games that link high-concept puzzle-solving with romantic introspection. Like the relationship it maps, the game is at its most elegant and pleasing in the early stages, when its challenges are clearly stated and simply solved. Even so, the creative possibilities of this Russian doll world seem to extend beyond this brief, delightful exploration."
4137,228,Maquette,75,Launcher (The Washington Post),"Mar 23, 2021",Maquette is an excellent look at how these two characters grow — I just wish the puzzles could have evolved in the same way.

4141,228,Maquette,70,Checkpoint Gaming,"May 29, 2021","Maquette is a beautiful puzzle game with a catchy soundtrack that really sets the chill yet heart-breaking vibe of the game. The way it messes around with space and depth keeps things fresh throughout and the game looks damn fine, making it an overall positive experience. However, it had an opportunity to make much stronger links between its puzzle world and its narrative world and it saddens me that this didn’t occur."
4142,228,Maquette,70,Meristation,"Mar  9, 2021","Maquette stands out for an excellent love story that affects the aesthetics

fresh, natural, credible, and its development makes us want to move forward."
4143,228,Maquette,70,Hardcore Gamer,"Mar  8, 2021","Even with the annoyance of the narrator being so utterly clueless, there’s no question that Maquette is effective at illustrating the pain of a good relationship gone bad.  The integration of puzzles and story never gel as it should, with only the setting feeling like it was at all related to the narrated events, but even so the pace of each was strong enough that it never feels like things lag — solve puzzle, get story.  Usually just a few lines at a time, hovering over a wall or other piece of environment, but it still felt like a nice way to mark progress as one solution flowed into another.  Without the story Maquette would still be a nicely-intriguing puzzler, and the scaling of the environments made for truly enjoyable moments when what seemed like a small irrelevant detail on a prop turned into the solution to a whole area.  At this point it should be clear that I’ve got mixed feelings on Maquette, but there’s no question that I’m glad to have played it and won’t be forgetting the game any time soon."
4144,228,Maquette,70,Critical Hit,"Mar  8, 2021","Romantic relationships have their ups and downs, and players will likely go through the same experience with Maquette, which seesaws between satisfying and frustrating. Charming world design and bittersweet relationship observations are offset by a couple of opaque puzzles and patches of gameplay clunkiness (bad enough to force level restarts), which mar the overall sense of enjoyment."
4145,228,Maquette,70,The Indie Game Website,"Mar  5, 2021","Maquette is a sort of sketch of a finished sculpture, or an architectural model… is the game saying this relationship was a sketch of better times, a process to go through in order to reach some future ideal? If so, it’s a well-worn narrative, and nothing is added by its puzzles. It ends up feeling like a clumsy mash-up of Synecdoche, New York and 500 Days of Summer, but without the introspection of either. At the very least, its puzzles and environments are captivating, but unlike its lateral thinking solutions, it never brings a new angle to its central narrative."
4146,228,Maquette,70,Gaming Nexus,"Mar  2, 2021","Maquette has a great puzzle mechanic as its central hook, though it sometimes struggles with obtuse implementation and fussy controls. Nonetheless, the narrative arc of the young relationship at the center of the game is well worth a bit of frustration to experience. Some lovely visuals and music make playing Maquette that much more rewarding."
4147,228,Maquette,70,IGN,"Mar  1, 2021","Maquette is a clever and gorgeous puzzle game, even if it doesn’t push the boundaries of its recursive concept very far past that initial sense of wonder."
4148,228,Maquette,60,Adventure Gamers,"Sep  7, 2021","It’s got an interesting gameplay construct and some gorgeously animated locations to explore, but some clumsy moments with controls and unclear leaps of puzzle logic mean that Maquette’s tale of whirlwind romance only flutters rather than flies."
4149,228,Maquette,60,GAMINGbible,"Mar  5, 2021","Maquette, in many ways, is a delight. Visually it's stunning, and the puzzles you encounter are often nice little brain teasers - I can imagine playing on a sofa with a significant other would elicit some fun conversations in the same way a murder mystery might. It has its problems and it's not perfect, but, as I said, you should think of Maquette as a rom-com of games. Not the highest form of art and not up for an Oscar nomination, but something you can certainly enjoy on a rainy Sunday afternoon."
4150,228,Maquette,40,TheGamer,"Mar  3, 2021","I was really hoping to be wowed by Maquette, but my time spent with it was not the magical, romantic experience I was hoping for. The bugs, overall wonkiness, and lame puzzle design annoyed me to no end. Especially when it would punish me by making me start a chapter over because it had broken itself. As a result, my already low tolerance of the love story between Michael and Kenzie grew to the point where I couldn't stand the couple. I would actively cheer when things went wrong because I didn't like them. The game seemingly wants you to feel like their relationship is one for the ages, but it just felt like a couple who had issues after the honeymoon period was over. It's a tale as old as time, but not one worth basing a game on."
4151,229,Boyfriend Dungeon,81,RPG Fan,"Sep  7, 2021","Despite some minor flaws, I rather enjoyed Boyfriend Dungeon. At around five to eight hours long, it might be a bit on the short side for those expecting the lengthier content of most dungeon crawlers, but I felt the length was perfect for conveying the story Kitfox Games wanted to tell. Fans of outright challenging games might want to look elsewhere, but those more interested in story and narrative choice with enjoyable-albeit-simple gameplay might want to give this game a look. Getting attached to your weapons takes on a whole new and surprisingly welcome meaning here!"

4159,229,Boyfriend Dungeon,70,Jeuxvideo.com,"Aug 22, 2021","Boyfriend Dungeon is worth the detour for its very catchy concept alone. After all, what other game will have you dating half-man, half-weapon people that you can wield in dungeons? The first hours of the Kitfox Games title are very eye-catching. But the studio struggles to keep the fun going. This is due to the dates that drag on and the phases of action that generally lack diversity, both for the ""dunjs"" and for the weapons on offer.

With more characters teased for the future, I can’t wait to dive in to see what’s next."
4161,229,Boyfriend Dungeon,70,Noisy Pixel,"Aug 17, 2021","Conclusively, while I certainly enjoyed my time with Boyfriend Dungeon, the sudden end to its narrative and the half-empty world map left me feeling like I had just finished an Early Access game rather than a full experience. I don’t generally have an issue with brevity in games, but the end to this one just left me craving more because I loved the cast, the representation, and the addictive leveling system. I definitely recommend this title to those who want to dip their toes in the water of dating sims, but a lack of challenge and a rather shallow conclusion end up holding it back from being a must-play experience."

Only the procedural generation is on the difficulty, allowing for developers Clever Beans to have handcrafted each dungeon in a stunning hand-brushed art style and have each playthrough feel that bit different, as the increased difficulty of a particular dungeon brings new creatures, paths, and opportunities. While not perfect, some things like the rather barren overworld as well as some bugs standing out, the character development, emergent storytelling and tight combat does more than enough to let this stand out."
4167,230,Gods Will Fall,78,GameStar,"Jan 29, 2021","Only the combat system is not precise and varied enough for me, a little more fine-tuning would have been necessary here. But that makes up for the charming indie game with charm and its unique graphic style."

I still really enjoyed my time with this one, but only after I brought out my controller and chose characters that didn’t walk at the speed of snail. There is so much potential here, so if you’re not sold yet, please either check it out on console or keep this one on your radar and revisit in a few months. Gods Will Fall has solid bones, and with a little more love and attention, it will achieve the greatness it seeks."

Equipped with an effective artistic direction, unique bosses and dungeons, and a link mechanic that works, the game manages to make us want to play and replay in order to meet the proposed challenge, and manage to defeat the ten deities present. The proposed experience is therefore pleasant, and the studio really holds something. Sadly, Gods Will Fall constantly seems on restraint, leaving a lingering impression of superficiality and repetitiveness."

Its enormous world map and myriad of secrets will keep you entertained for tens of hours, but you should beware that its high difficulty means that it aims at players who really want to test their reflexes and lightning-fast combination of special powers."
4180,231,Aeterna Noctis,80,Hey Poor Player,"Dec 17, 2021","The phrase Metroidvania should not be applied casually, for those two games expanded what was possible, tossing gamers down cryptic corridors instead of cute green pipes. Aeterna Noctis may not innovate much, but it’s a worthy addition to this sub-genre that any fan of Hollow Knight will be pleased to play, if they can overlook the redundancy of gameplay elements. The frequency of the jumping puzzles will push many casual gamers away, but those looking for a classic, hardcore challenge will find it welcomes you with its skeletal hands."

Its beautiful world and gorgeous soundtrack make exploring Aeterna is a joy, even when its high difficulty is knocking you down over and over.

That level of heartfelt dedication makes it all the more frustrating when you get caught up on the areas where it still needs polish. I enjoyed a lot of the game, but I remember the annoyances more than the enjoyment. If you're willing to work past that, there's a lot to play in Aeterna Noctis, but it's easy to imagine someone reaching a particularly annoying bit of platforming and moving on to something else, especially because the game's long length can make it feel more exhausting than exhilarating. Metroidvania fans should absolutely give it a shot, but don't expect something as easy to pick-up-and-play as some of the genre greats."

The good artistic direction, the excellent combat system and the well-conceived boss fights end up being suffocated by a linear and tedious progression, a victim in turn of the desire to fill the game with content even when there is no need for it.

That said, New World does those familiar things very competently. It looks great and controls well, either with mouse and keyboard, or the slightly less optimized controller. Survival mechanics and crafting are core elements and not side gigs, but luckily, they are engaging and layered with depth. New World rewards the player for just about everything, all the time, and there is always something to do, whether fighting, farming or exploring and questing. It’s accessible to solo players and embraces the PvP and coop communities with a great deal of content. All MMORPGs are major time commitments by definition, so whether New World can hold your attention long term is probably a function of your expectations, and whether you connect with what the game has to offer. New World probably won’t ever surprise you, but it won’t disappoint you either."

New World is a fun, solid MMORPG packed with plenty of enjoyable content that will keep players busy for a long, long time.

The amount of mystery, content, and challenge ROBI Studios packs into a $20 package is quite impressive and left me hungry for more even after the game’s conclusion.

4240,233,Blue Fire,50,GameSpot,"Feb 19, 2021","It's disappointing that Blue Fire is unquestionably fun to move around in but is hampered by design decisions that hold back its free-form platforming. It's difficult to experiment with the reaches of your agility when it's so easy to lose large swathes of progress due to a misstep, a punishment that permeates not only exploration but the otherwise expertly designed platforming side challenges. Its economy relies too heavily on one in-game currency and unnecessarily blocks progression, making it feel like Blue Fire isn't respectful of your time. You'd have to really fall in love with Blue Fire's one well-tuned mechanic to make its entire adventure feel worthwhile."

4242,234,This Is the President,80,Hey Poor Player,"Dec 24, 2021","This is the President is a perfectly patriotic blend of This is the Police, Suzerain, and We. The Revolution, presenting players with scandal after scandal after scandal to wriggle their way out of. Although there are a small handful of choices that corral you into picking the “right” option, the way you cope with the consequences is largely up to you. If you enjoy a novel’s worth of deranged narrative gameplay where choices matter like your life depends on them (and they do), This is the President will command enough mystery, intrigue, and excitement for even the highest of offices."

4247,234,This Is the President,60,Screen Rant,"Dec 10, 2021","This Is The President certainly has its good moments, with its silly humor hitting the mark more often than not and its core plot servings its purpose well.

Also, Gamepad is for once very well exploited with a Camera Obscura to be controlled directly with the gyroscope (or the sticks if you wish). Unfortunately, the numerous back and forths to do during the game and the general stiffness of the gameplay make the pleasure of the game fall very quickly, leaving only a nice adventure, but far from being memorable."

It's not a remake, nor a remaster, feeling more like a re-release with a few added features. Visually, it's barely different to the Wii U Release, so if you've already played it, then there's not much I can say. However, considering the original was limited to the Wii U, with a limited audience, this version brings it over to modern consoles and the PC, keeping the excellent atmosphere and different combat system and making it control better than expected.

Its predominant mechanic is clever. It’s short. But it stands as an example of just how easily a game can be undone by only one or two critical shortcomings. There’s a world in which a few chewy brain teasers would be enough for me to overlook some one-dimensional characters–this is a puzzle game after all.

The gameplay mechanics deliver one cool idea, the monster resurrection, but fail to make full use of it, especially when players need to deal with bosses or the more capable enemies of later levels. I wanted the game to give me more reasons to use the monsters I revived, to understand them, to build strategies around the ones I chose to carry around. The development team clearly understands how important is to ground players into a narrative. But they need to make sure that there’s deeper integration between the world and the gameplay to create a successful rogue-lite. Right now Sword of the Necromancer is like one of its monsters, intriguing at first but quickly dropped when it no longer seems useful."
4278,238,Sword of the Necromancer,70,Gaming Nexus,"Mar 31, 2021","Sword of the Necromancer is by no means a perfect game, but it's still enjoyable with a few issues here and there. Tama never feels like she's getting stronger and the monsters you summon are hit and miss as to whether they'll actually be effective in a fight or just randomly run around the room going nowhere near where you want them to. The bosses are also hit and miss when it comes to those that require strategy and those that just have you run away for a bit before getting in one or two hits and repeating. However, the story is great and well voice-acted and the soundtrack has a lot of nice tracks to listen to."

4287,239,The Invisible Hand,75,Softpedia,"May 17, 2021","The Invisible Hand could have been a great if simplistic stock trading-focused game, if it dropped the satire elements, choosing to focus on how the market can be manipulated and on how rivalries develop between traders. The title could also have been a solid satire of modern wild capitalism and the way it lacks morals or compassion if it allowed itself to invest more in relationships and good dialogue and less in the actual stock-based gameplay. The problem is that the development team wants to deliver on both concepts and fails to reach the potential of either of them. The limited appeal of the presentation does not help with either of them."

Even I could have some fun while playing the game. Ultimately though, this game is not made for everyone, and that’s okay.

Its loot and combat only improve with time without asking players to mindlessly grind just to keep progressing. The obvious push towards co-op, as opposed to single-player, may be a bummer to some, but even those who venture into Xenomorph swarms on their own will have plenty to look forward to in Aliens: Fireteam Elite."

There's so much satisfaction in customizing and managing a handful of classes with enough depth to transform them into the Colonial Marine you need at a given time, along with a plethora of great weapons to make the moment-to-moment action engaging from the first time you pull the trigger. What it lacks in dread it makes up for in pure white-knuckle action, making Aliens: Fireteam Elite a great place to engage with this iconic sci-fi franchise again."

Nevertheless an aha experience sets in for me at some point. I had a lot of fun while testing, but like sexual intercourse, it is unfortunately mostly boring if you do it with yourself. And because I have to play the same missions over and over again, i got bored soon. Nevertheless 40 bucks are still an acceptable price for a few hours of co-op fun in the Aliens universe."

The caveats, of course, are having to put up with repetitive scenarios and some excruciatingly drawn-out missions.

Trying different classes, abilities, and unlockable weapons help keep gameplay refreshing during your first run. However, Fireteam Elite wants to be replayable and what’s on offer simply isn’t that fun to return to. Formulaic level design and often buggy AI make finishing missions a chore rather than a triumph.

The result of this project (which was started by college students) is a great puzzle-platform experience, with a distinct art style and a story open to interpretation. The short campaign doesn’t stop the emotional attachment with protagonist San and the fellow adventurers we find along the way. The Portuguese studio made something out of very little, intelligently using the game mechanics it introduces throughout the campaign"

If I had to find something “wrong” with Out of Line, I suppose that it’s perhaps a little on the short side (it can be beaten within just a couple of hours). The default controls are also not ideal; the keyboard keys work just fine (A moves you to the left, D to the right, W jumps), but paired with having to click the mouse buttons to throw and retrieve your spear in conjunction just didn’t feel very smooth to me. Thankfully, that was easily solved by simply using my PS4 controller. These are honestly minor complaints, though. The game is beautiful and oddly moving, considering the complete lack of dialogue. If you need something a little different from your standard platformer, give Out of Line a try."

The new/old Infiltration mechanic is a welcome changeup from the usual routine of explore and battle, but maybe not enough to entirely wipe away the feeling that the Siege of Paris is sticking a little too close to the template. What it lacks in creativity, bold new mechanics and mission structures, The Siege of Paris delivers in art direction, atmosphere and story. Though I personally enjoyed the visit to Ireland a little more, Eivor’s trip to Francia is by no means lacking in quality. For better or worse, it’s just more of the same."

As an expansion of Valhalla, The Siege of Paris seriously trims the fat and provides one of the better story arcs we've seen for this entry. The welcome reintroduction of black box missions provides a diversion from the regular grind that is so prevalent in its other content. It's a step in the right direction."

Its story provides a truly memorable menace in King Charles, but otherwise doesn’t stand out much from what we’ve already seen, substituting Breton soldiers with Frankish ones.

Whether it was The Witcher 3‘s Blood and Wine or New Vegas‘ Old World Blues, a good DLC takes the best aspects of the base game and raises them up while including a unique, new spin. Assassin’s Creed Valhalla‘s Siege of Paris is antithetical to that. The game’s best parts — its world and characters — are left in the muck, while a boring gameplay loop and heavy-handed story take center stage. Of course, some players will enjoy having more of the same to explore, but considering how long it takes to even finish Valhalla, I couldn’t imagine coming back for seconds. When I first arrived in the game’s version of Paris, I saw an exhausted, burnt-out land. When I left it, I could certainly sympathize."

While the experience is epic, even for a total noob at realistic sports games like me, I have to dock points for the rough on-boarding experience in this otherwise excellent title. A persistent beginner will have the game grow on them and potentially make them an even bigger Supercross fan.

While graphics are perhaps the best in the series to date, they still appear flat in some areas, especially the compound. It’s nice to have character creation, but the lack of female pro riders feels like a tremendous missed opportunity to grow the popularity of the sport and game.

When playing the game on PC, I couldn’t help but notice how the visuals drag behind the standards of modern gaming. Character models are the same as before and by each year they get more outdated. Landscapes look bland and boring and there are hardly any particle effects which would have helped to improve the feel of ripping through mud and gravel. Of course, it’s always great when a yearly iteration of a sports game has had courage to revamp its core experience.

4389,246,Nanotale - Typing Chronicles,85,Softpedia,"Apr  1, 2021","Nanotale – Typing Chronicles manages to put words at the heart of both the action and the story in a unique way. The centrality of typing is justified in the world that the developers have created and makes for some interesting challenges for gamers. The more classic exploration elements, based around the word magic system, also work well. The biggest problem is that the constant keyboard action can become a little tiring. Keep sessions to a little under an hour to make sure that you do not simply burn out from spelling. Nanotale is also a video game that would benefit immensely from an investment in a very good keyboard."
4390,246,Nanotale - Typing Chronicles,80,God is a Geek,"Apr 11, 2021","Nanotale: Typing Chronicles will be a difficult sell for some people for very obvious reasons, but those willing to try something else and give themselves over to something a little bit different to the games we’re all used to will find a charming, likeable adventure."
4391,246,Nanotale - Typing Chronicles,75,KeenGamer,"Mar 31, 2021","Nanotale - Typing Chronicles raises the bar for typing games across the board. This is a title that proves teaching tools can make entertaining games as well. The version of the game I played will need some patches before release, but after the bug fixes, I have no qualms recommending it to anyone looking to brush up on their keyboard skills."
4392,246,Nanotale - Typing Chronicles,70,DarkZero,"Apr  6, 2021","Nanotale – Typing Chronicles was a great experience, I’ve never played a typing game before, so this was a fresh idea to me, and it definitely won’t be my last. Fishing Cactus have released 2 games in the Typing Chronicles series, and I hope they don’t stop there; I don’t think they really pushed the boundaries of what this kind of game can achieve but that only gives me hope for the next instalment."
4393,246,Nanotale - Typing Chronicles,65,Noisy Pixel,"Apr  5, 2021","At its core, Nanotale is certainly enjoyable. The simple act of typing being morphed into an RPG format sets a sturdy foundation for a fun experience. Further, the adventure is one that I genuinely felt attached to. It’s a shame that so much weighs on this, though, from soft locks to unoptimized systems and choppy framerates, a handful of offputting implementations hinders this overall decent idea for an adventure."

4398,247,Demon Turf,75,KeenGamer,"Nov 11, 2021","You could say that Demon Turf is one Hell of a time. So much variety in worlds and challenges. Heavy emphasis on speed, flexibility, and experimentation. With all the freedom afforded to the player, Demon Turf manages to be a generally great platformer-adventure with just enough on the side to keep things eventful and fresh. If not for some bloated level design, and with heavier polish on outside elements such as combat, this would be a bonafide classic. Even now, it's a phenomenal option for platformer fanatics new and old."

4400,247,Demon Turf,70,Checkpoint Gaming,"Nov  9, 2021","Demon Turf is a good game begging the eyes of those invested in the collectathon niche. Plenty of fun hours are on offer to watch those numbers tick up and pull off some tight and joyful platforming. It may waver in some of its later combat and ability design, also proving unfriendly for younger audiences. Though just as much forgiveness is issued when you consider how devoted the game is to tackling its genre. If you’re looking for a more modest and fun game to wind down the year, this is it."
4401,247,Demon Turf,70,Hardcore Gamer,"Nov  4, 2021","Despite its missed opportunities and ideas that don’t gel with the core gameplay, developer Fabraz’s foray into three-dimensional platforming remains a fun-if-flawed hearkening to the genre’s glory days. By far the studio’s best trait in Demon Turf is in its relentless distilling of what made those original 3D platformers not just a joy to play, but a joy to finally see beaten."
4402,247,Demon Turf,70,Noisy Pixel,"Nov  3, 2021","Demon Turf has a lot to offer in its platforming design that challenges the player at every corner. It’s a shame that it becomes repetitive upon multiple visits, but the charm of these characters adds loads to the overall experience. It’s a platformer, not much more, but it doesn’t need to be because it’s got attitude, so hail to the Demon Queen, baby."
4403,247,Demon Turf,50,Destructoid,"Nov  3, 2021","It’s not a soulless game or one without a spark, there’s definitely a lot of love in the final product. It just seriously needed a few more sets of eyes on it to draw out its flaws. A lot of the things that vexed me most severely could be fixed with a few more passes of the floor buffer. Yet here we are, and Demon Turf doesn’t strike me as territory worth conquering."

4406,248,King of Seas,74,Hooked Gamers,"Jun 14, 2021","Like many of my piratical favourites, King of Seas doesn’t take itself too seriously, and as a result makes it a fun game for casual players. My main gripe is that the side quests aren’t varied enough and do get a touch monotonous. Unfortunately, they are the quickest way to gaining experience when grinding through the levels is required. But that said, sailing across the map is a relaxing experience, with King of Seas allowing would-be-pirates to play the game their own way. Simple controls, and fun story, and enjoyable gameplay mean that it is a game for all wannabe swashbucklers."
4407,248,King of Seas,72,Multiplayer.it,"May 24, 2021",King of Seas has almost everything that it needs to work properly but trips over his own feet and becomes repetitive.

It has all the tools needed to keep you entertained for many hours. Unfortunately, it's also lacking in certain departments, leading to a more streamlined approach that can't compare to the classic."
4409,248,King of Seas,70,GameSkinny,"May 24, 2021","Ultimately, King of Seas makes for a great take on the pirate’s life. Admittedly, it’s a slow burner at first and because of the more precise nature of its combat, 3DCloud’s newest game won’t appeal to everyone, so I’d recommend trying the demo first. Should you stick with it, there’s an entertaining world with enjoyable exploration, in-depth combat, and pleasant visuals. Backed up by a great swashbuckling soundtrack, these aren’t shallow waters."
4410,248,King of Seas,68,Ragequit.gr,"May 30, 2021","An action story using a pirate ship as a storytelling vessel. While the action part is quite enjoyable, the game lacks the necessary depth in mechanisms to enrich its gameplay and deliver that special something that would increase its replay value and make it last in time."
4411,248,King of Seas,67,Worth Playing,"Jul  6, 2021","Overall, King of Seas is a serviceable action-RPG with a pirates theme that is intended for a more casual audience. Its mechanics are solid, and the title is entertaining enough for short bursts of gameplay, but its grindy and repetitive nature quickly takes the wind out of its sails. Some of my complaints are certainly fixable in future updates, at which point I imagine the game to be a solid option for those who yearn for a decent but simplistic pirate life simulator. For now, I'd steer clear until some changes are implemented, or you can wait for a substantial sale."

If you stick through the grind, this is the sort of game that is more than good enough to drop in and out of, giving you a good outlet to meet your pirate-related urges."
4415,248,King of Seas,60,Eurogamer Italy,"Jun 29, 2021","King of Seas is an average production, at times interesting, but that on the whole fails to involve players. Game dynamics soon become repetitive, the narrative struggles to take off and the artistic side could have been better. A real pity, since pirate games are never enough and the project was quite intriguing."
4416,248,King of Seas,60,Shacknews,"May 25, 2021","King of Seas does lots of things well, from its visual presentation to the simplicity of its sailing mechanics. It touches base with many of the things that made classics out of the games that came prior while streamlining the experience into something that feels like a store-brand version of the thing I actually wanted."
4417,248,King of Seas,50,Screen Rant,"May 24, 2021","King of Seas is an engaging, challenging RPG open-world game. Progressing through the story is rewarding thanks to the influence player choices have on enemy encounters and world exploration. With a few changes to the controls and the introduction of more intuitive world maps, King of Seas could offer fans of pirate narratives or open-world exploration style RPG games a replayable and immersive gaming experience."

4425,249,Conway: Disappearance at Dahlia View,60,TheSixthAxis,"Nov 23, 2021","Conway is a solid detective game that ticks a lot of the right boxes and fulfils standard sleuthing expectations. It leans well into the crotchety-old-protagonist stereotype which more often than not creates an interesting tension between Conway and his ensemble cast of neighbors, as well as with you as a player. It’s not tremendously challenging in terms of hard solves, but it’s more about the journey. You could do worse than spend 10 hours immersed in the small and all too human miseries of Dahlia View."

There are hidden truths lying everywhere in this community. Unfortunately, despite a proven premise, a pretty presentation, and a promising protagonist, there was no substance to fully immerse me in the narrative of Conway: Disappearance at Dahlia View. The plot was predictable, the slow pacing was punishing, and the lack of music made it difficult to trudge through."

It’s not exactly a hidden gem but it does contain the occasional glint of something special. Perfunctory writing drags down the tension and a limited range of puzzles and interactivity struggles to pull it all back together. Worse though, Conway’s brutish ways filled me with unease from the first snap of the camera, rather than filling me with the joy of a good detective story, I just felt like an intruder."

4429,250,Astria Ascending,90,Gamepressure,"Sep 27, 2021","Astria Ascending holds modern JRPGs to a new standard. The sprites and environments are beautifully hand-drawn and the characters are rich with nuance and passion. But where the game really shines is its incredibly deep combat and progression system that will have you excitedly strategizing between dungeons. Some small technical issues do hold it back from being perfect, however, the issues pale in comparison to the majority of the game."
4430,250,Astria Ascending,85,COGconnected,"Sep 27, 2021","While parts of it felt long and grindy, the English cast is abysmal, and the dungeons design themselves left more to be desired,  Astria Ascending is still a solid entry in the JRPG genre. It does what it sets out to do and at its price point it does it pretty well. While it may not quite rise to the heights of some of the forebears it tries to evoke from Square Enix’s past, its friendlier price point makes it a great entry that can steal away 25-30 hours of time. Just don’t expect it to sway you over if you don’t already like the genre. As its tendency to get grindy, and its overwrought characters may not change your mind."
4431,250,Astria Ascending,80,GameCritics,"Oct 19, 2021","If one is able to put these narrative issues aside, Astria Ascending is a solid and beautiful J-inspired RPG with some noticeable (but ultimately minor) flaws. JRPG fans looking for a new world to sink dozens of hours into need look no further."
4432,250,Astria Ascending,80,SpazioGames,"Sep 27, 2021","Astria Ascending is a game that reminds the golden era of JRPGs, with a modern twist tied to a brilliant combat system and a renewed job system. It is a must have for turn-based combat lovers."
4433,250,Astria Ascending,80,PC Invasion,"Sep 27, 2021","Astria Ascending is filled with countless features and mechanics to add more flavor to an adventure that can last dozens of hours.

4434,250,Astria Ascending,80,Gamer Escape,"Sep 27, 2021","It feels like a throwback to the PlayStation era in the best way, when there were always new JRPGs showing up in the hopes of getting the same sort of cult reception as Final Fantasy VII, always new titles to try out and new stories to experience, some of them winding up a bit generic but others turning into unexpected little gems along the way. Astria Ascending feels like one of those gems, except it’s a new game right now and benefits from all the hindsight that implies. If you love JRPGs, give this one a good shot. You’ll be glad you did."
4435,250,Astria Ascending,76,RPG Fan,"Sep 27, 2021","Ultimately, Astria Ascending is as flawed as it is fascinating. It has its moments, but the story is uneven, the dialogue is rough, and the combat is fine, but it doesn’t do enough to stand out in a crowded genre. It hurts to say that, as at some points, the story feels like one that needs to be heard, and there are some parts that I won’t soon forget. As the satellite falls to Earth, it mostly burns up on re-entry, but there is a painful beauty to it all while it lasts."

4438,250,Astria Ascending,70,ZTGD,"Oct 18, 2021","The beautiful graphics, unique characters and fun combat doesn’t take away from the fact that this is an old-school RPG at heart with new school wrappings. AA boasts a fun take on the traditional job systems found in JRPGs, I just wish it was given a story to match all of the great things it has going for it. Fights can drag on at times much like the JRPG’s of old, what helps is the amazing art and effects from the various attacks. But while fans of the older Final Fantasy’s and even Dragon Quest games may enjoy this trip of nostalgia; those folks raised on Persona 5’s and the last few Final Fantasy’s might be in for a bit of a shock. Astria Ascending isn’t a bad game, just a flawed one; but if you enjoy Vanillaware games and don’t mind a grind a lot of fun can be had here."

With somewhat standard-feeling combat that is overly punishing at the default difficulty, I felt at a loss as far as what to concentrate on to improve my party. Astria Ascending tells a beautiful story, but too often that story is buried behind too many mechanics and systems."
4440,250,Astria Ascending,70,Noisy Pixel,"Sep 27, 2021","Astria Ascending had me invested in the 25 hours it took me to get to the final dungeon. However, that comes with a padded runtime of level grinding, lengthy battles, dungeon navigation confusion, and many menu interactions. So if you begin, prepare not to understand what is going on until 10 hours into the game, but if you don’t have that time, don’t bother. However, those who do get far enough are in for a genuinely fun JPRG experience that only requires a few quality-of-life improvements."

Far from being content to be a beautiful postcard, the title does not forget to offer solid RPG mechanics to offer a tough challenge to fans of the genre. Unfortunately, its overly classic course and ergonomic concerns make the adventure at times laborious, at least to detract from the enjoyment of the player. Nonetheless, it remains a nice title which, behind its flaws, has an atmosphere that will delight those nostalgic for old-fashioned J-RPGs."

The good news is that Artisan Studio seem committed to updating the game over time, so ideally the rough edges present will get smoothed out. But at the moment, Astria Ascending’s innovative combat, gorgeous art, and esoteric story are overshadowed by frustrating cutscenes, painful pacing, and many half-baked mechanics. Hitoshi Sakimoto’s soundtrack sets a high bar, but in its current state, the rest of Astria Ascending has trouble rising to meet it."

4446,250,Astria Ascending,50,The Indie Game Website,"Oct 25, 2021","Overall, Astria Ascending feels like a missed opportunity. Despite these issues, the game does right by its art direction and world-building, but the fundamental gameplay drags the whole experience down towards mundanity. Having to wait for the seven enemies in front of you to status lock you to death isn’t challenging and engaging combat; it’s tedious. Jumping through dungeons hoping to find a doorway that leads to the next area isn’t interesting trial-and-error exploration; it’s dreadful. In the JRPG marketplace that’s filled with all sorts of storytelling quirks and eccentricities, tedium is simply no longer acceptable."
4447,250,Astria Ascending,50,GameSkinny,"Oct  5, 2021","Astria Ascending wants to be so many things, and perhaps that’s part of the problem. Instead of trying to be mature or recognizable, it should focus on its unique qualities and develop them into something interesting. Whatever the case, it’s difficult to recommend Astria Ascending. There are dozens of other RPGs to give your time and money to, but if you’re curious about this one anyway, I’d strongly suggest waiting for a sale."

However, these problems are secondary to the mixed, complicated emotions I experienced–from the pure joy and satisfaction when finishing a challenging area, to more complex and bitter thoughts about our humanity–and our efforts to be better. Hypervisor provokes conversations not only about our daily dependence on technology, our increasing levels of anxiety around it, or the isolation bubbles created through social media, but how our imminent future could be made even worse.

I am, at this moment, thinking about how great it would be for Recompile to garner the attention, respect, and acclaim it deserves. This is no ordinary game - it is brilliant and ambitious and frustrating in the one and only way that frustration can be a positive term. Recompile is a rare gem in a cave of unremarkable cobblestone, a pearl among cracked shells and coarse sand. If you do one thing after reading this review, do both yourself and I a favour: download Recompile, and once you're done with it, tell your friends to download it, too."

The mix of the stunning aesthetic, beautiful music, fun combat, and interesting hacking systems all make for something that feels different to any other Metroidvania I've played before.

4456,251,Recompile,65,PC Invasion,"Aug 31, 2021","The exploration, narrative elements, art style, and audio are all excellent in Recompile, but the platforming begins to feel redundant after a while. Especially since the level design doesn't provide any clear direction and leads to regular backtracking and second guessing. There are also missed opportunities where the gameplay could have been more interesting and balanced. Still, the game should scratch that itch for those always looking for something new to experience."
4457,251,Recompile,65,MGG,"Aug 19, 2021","In the end, despite some big design mistakes, Recompile remains a very funny title that will offer a wonderful trip in a very colorful universe to its players. The flaws and the too great facility of the title are, without any doubt, compensated by its enchanting atmosphere and its more than pleasant game feeling. Far from being a must-have Metroidvania, Recompile will nevertheless be the kind of title that, although it doesn't offer anything new, will keep a small place in the memory of the players who will have the courage to launch into its adventure."

I enjoyed myself at times, but ultimately feel like it did not do remotely enough to stand apart from the rest of the genre. Recompile is an interesting concept, but one that feels more like an incomplete idea. I loved the concepts, but there are some core gameplay things that would need to be fixed in order for me to truly feel like the idea made it’s way onto my computer the way the developers intended."

Its platforming and puzzles are too simplistic, and its infrequent combat can frustrate, but hunting for bits of lore between those sections still managed to stay interesting. It's a short-lived and sometimes forgettable metroidvania, but with a story that still makes it a few hours well spent."

Chronicle of Innsmouth: Mountains of Madness is a game that knows its limits and strives to do its best with the resources it has. The story is short, but well written and fascinating, the English acting is good and background illustrations are often inspiring.

Whatever problems I may have had with the puzzles — and I certainly didn’t enjoy going to the internet for help twice — the game gets the feel of Lovecraft right, and that’s worth overlooking a few awkward design choices."

The new Specialist system might seem like sacrilege at first, but it opens up gameplay opportunities that weren’t possible in previous titles. The massive, well-designed maps offer plenty of room for experimentation and emergent stories, and the modes are a blast. And that’s just All-Out Warfare. Between that, Hazard Zone, and the expansive Battlefield Portal, Battlefield 2042 has something for everyone, without feeling like it’s stretched too thin. It’s a true evolution of the series, one that pushes back against a stagnation that threatened the series’ future. It won’t be for everyone, but for players who crave imagination and fun from their Battlefields, it will give them everything that they crave and more."

Not content with fully succeeding in its traditional multi-pan, this opus has the luxury of offering additional gigantic and highly qualitative content to players. Portal mode seems ready to keep all of its promises and allow the creation of various modes whether they are crazy or competitive. Hazard Zone, on the other hand, succeeds in unexpected situations and offers a particularly successful reading of the game in squads. Beautiful as a truck, generous, modular and damn fun to play, 2042 is neither more nor less than one of the best games of the license."

The game’s developers have not only succeeded in that regard, but they have gone above and beyond. All-Out Warfare is a fantastic evolution on the classic Battlefield experience, modernizing the franchise with more scale, spectacle, and ways to play than ever before. Battlefield Portal and Hazard Zone likewise shine in their own regards, with the former proving that it can serve as the base for players to create their own unique experiences within 2042.

It is rare to change weapons; once you find your ""heart"" weapon, you never let go of it, except for a few exceptions. Battlefield 2042 has a bright future ahead of it due to the developers' complete coverage of the game for a full year. If players feel that there is a lack of content, remember that seasons will bring new game modes, new maps, but also new specialists. Hazard Zone and Portal mode are a welcome boost to the license, and it's great to see that Battlefield is still able to deliver new and exciting content."

The developers of DICE and Ripple Effect Studios were keen to please neophytes but also unconditional fans. The recipe works despite a few small problems such as the insufficient number of maps or even some gameplay issues related to specialists, weapon balancing or the spacialization of footsteps. The title being keen to expand via its future Battlepass, it will be necessary to judge the content over the long term to see whether or not the content is up to par.

4492,253,Battlefield 2042,80,Checkpoint Gaming,"Nov 11, 2021","The biggest and boldest Battlefield to date, 2042 combines trademark action with impressive innovations. Experimentation with loadout and attachment changes drive the enormous spectacle of 128 player warzones and dynamic weather events. Hazard Zone provides the grounds for extremely tactical gameplay but needs refinement to make it a lasting experience. The shining star without question is Portal, allowing series veterans to jump back into their favourite legacy maps and muck around with creative modes and features – it's basically four games in one package. If it wasn't for a few poorly designed 2042 maps, combat balancing issues, and performance concerns, Battlefield 2042 might be the best in the franchise."

No single player, and the focus is on large scale battles and creating your own experiences in Battlefield Portal. This works out well, as the unprecedented scale and dynamic gameplay is very good. It is also more accessible than ever before, and that is just the tip of the iceberg. Hazard Zone mode is also a valuable addition, and the possibilities with Portal are endless. All good news, but keep in mind that there will be bugs, unstable frame rates and lag. In other words, the basis is very good, but it can still use some polishing."

There’s 7 maps in the base game (this doesn’t include the 6 maps available in Portal, because those are just direct pulls from their respective original games), and 3 game modes to choose from. The game is enjoyable, but it doesn’t do much to stand out from the last few iterations of the series and without a campaign, feels like it’s lacking in content. Hopefully some updates and adjustments can help clear up some of the issues I experienced, especially with the balancing in the Breakthrough mode. As it stands, if you’re looking for just more Battlefield, but with a different setting, this is a good option. If you’ve not been a big fan of Battlefield in the past, or at least in the recent past entries, I don’t think they’ve changed enough here to change your mind."

It lets you play a bunch of different kinds of FPS experiences--in different game modes, in different Portal rule sets, and even in the same match as you switch between characters. Portal lets you relive the Battlefield games of the past, but on the 2042 side, DICE has cherry-picked from popular trends like hero shooters and battle royales. The best part is that, mostly, it has done a really effective job of curating those additions so that they bring more to what players already like about Battlefield, rather than change what already works."
4505,253,Battlefield 2042,70,Easy Allies,"Nov 23, 2021","Battlefield 2042 is inconsistent. The maps and vehicular combat are top tier, while the specialists and redesigned scorecard diminish teamwork. Hazard Zone does its best to offset these issues, but playing without a dedicated squad can be tricky. Portal opens the window to what could be a brighter future for the franchise, and hopefully DICE adds meaningful updates to the service at a steady rate. Battlefield 2042 has a long and windy road ahead, and only time will define its lasting legacy. As of this moment, all but the most dedicated veterans should probably wait and see how things shake out."

The new Specialists are a great way to diversify the Gameplay and gives freedom to the players, BUT they kill the Teamplay with this new freedom. Hazard Zone has some great moments in it, BUT the devs forgot motivational systems for gamers to play it long time. The Gameplay is a good mix of the best Battlefields, BUT there are bugs all over the place. That’s all things that can be managed with patches and content updates in the future, but that should not be the standard for a release version.

I suspect more content is coming – at least more maps, but hopefully more modes, and maybe some AI opponents for single player opportunities – in which case this game may grow into something good (but you’ll have to buy the year one pass to get it).

This game is somewhat recommendable to Battlefield fans and those with a general interest in military-style shooters, but there is a strong chance that the game’s current flaws are going to really limit the potential for many. Because of this, if you’re considering this game, you may want to wait for a patch or two before you deploy to the battlefield."

It clearly wants to be like Call of Duty: Warzone, with its overreliance on fast-quip Specialists that will serve as mannequins for endless cosmetic microtransactions. It also wants to grab some of the audience who religiously play Hunt: Showdown or Escape from Tarkov with its undercooked Hazard Zone mode. Finally, it also wants to be Battlefield to what’s left of a dedicated fan base that’s been left to watch the franchise chase the tail of its competitors for years. We loved Battlefield because it wasn’t Call of Duty or Counter-Strike or Fortnite or Apex or any other popular shooter. This mismanaged project clearly needed more time in the oven and a cohesive design that works to Battlefield’s strengths rather than a game attempting to be multiple things to multiple audiences. In a year where so many releases have been marred by a lack of polish and bugs, Battlefield 2042 may be the biggest offender."

Explosions, tornados, and swooping helicopters look great. One day, they probably will be great. DICE is one of the best when it comes to post-launch patches - for better and for worse. But if you’re on the fence about buying Battlefield 2042, I would just wait. It’s hard for me to condone purchasing what is essentially an unfinished product - an unfinished product with Battle Passes, too. Just wait. It will be a better game in a year’s time.

4548,254,Sniper Elite VR,85,Digital Chumps,"Jul 12, 2021","For a VR experience, I have to say Sniper Elite VR is one of the better titles I have played. Part of that is surely from both the familiarity of the FPS genre and even more specifically the series itself. However, the variety of options lends itself well to a comfortable and enjoyable experience. The Aim Controller worked great, and though sure there are some camera/position glitches and some graphical issues from time to time as most any VR experience has, none of these were so off-putting as to keep me from playing. The narrative was interesting and well-told, too. Mission design is balanced well for a VR experience, meaning that it’s much more than ‘tech demo’ or entirely on rains, but, it’s not as wide in scope or sandboxy as a non-VR title either. In sum, for anyone looking for a good sniping experience in VR, this is an easy one to recommend."

It’s not without issues trying to find that balance between being a fun experience for all whilst giving VR veterans a videogame they can really get stuck into. When you do get into it though, Sniper Elite VR becomes a thoroughly engrossing VR shooter as you read the environment, study enemy movements and take that vital long-range shot. Doing that continually over the 7+ hour campaign seems very repetitive but lining up that perfect shot never is."
4552,254,Sniper Elite VR,80,UploadVR,"Jul  8, 2021","Sniper Elite has always been a bit of a b-movie treat by normal gaming standards and, while that’s still true of Sniper Elite VR, some of the series’ staple elements are really enhanced by the platform. Aiming down the scope, steadying your sights and pulling the trigger before readying the next round is a calculated and convincing process with perfectly streamlined authenticity. Throw in a variety of other objective types across a decent-length campaign, including comprehensive stealth segments and brilliantly rustic street shootouts and you’ve got a VR FPS that will tick a lot of boxes for a lot of headset owners. It’s not the platform’s most groundbreaking shooter, but Sniper Elite VR is proof you can teach an old dog new tricks, and that’s more than enough."

There's a forgettable story and mediocre shootouts when you're not handling a sniper rifle, and they both keep the game from standing out among more refined VR shooting offerings. If you are a fan of the franchise or you yearn for a good sniper rifle experience in VR, Sniper Elite VR is worth checking out."

But, on the other hand, it’s just a shame that things start to fall apart whenever you get up close and personal with your enemies...If you’re a fan of the Sniper Elite franchise and are looking for a fresh perspective on its blend of stealth action, Sniper Elite VR delivers the goods.

Sniper Elite delivers up some satisfying VR x-ray sniper kills, but once the novelty of that wears off, grinding through the rest of the campaign ends up being a bit of a chore. With no villains, real story, or any actual history to absorb, the game drifts through a seven-and-a-half-hour campaign of fight enemies, complete objective x, rinse, and repeat.

If you want to snipe enemies across a range of scenarios, all the while carrying out the actions required to reload a bolt-action rifle between shots, you’ll no doubt get some enjoyment out of it. It’s not particularly impressive visually, however, and beyond the additional arm-work required the dispatch the enemies you’re up against, the gameplay is rather basic. Throw in the additional fiddliness associated with VR, and the fact that the series’ kill-cam doesn’t quite gel with the format, and you have a game that’s fun to delve in and out of as a curio, but largely forgettable overall."
4566,254,Sniper Elite VR,50,Road to VR,"Jul 13, 2021","True to its name, Sniper Elite VR delivers strong sniping mechanics, but the surrounding action doesn't do it justice. With a great VR sniper scope implementation and the franchise's signature x-ray kill cam, delivering those long shots can definitely be satisfying. Unfortunately the homogenous enemies and weapons blur together against a backdrop of unmemorable levels and story. The game's graphical presentation on Quest is surprisingly good, with long draw distances, sharp imagery, and great performance. Sniper Elite VR is also a very comfortable game with a wide range of comfort options, but the teleport mode is painfully slow—to the point that I wouldn't recommend the game if you must play it with teleport."

I met a trader that traded in items I never saw or found. I also picked up multiple items that I found no purpose for, despite retracing steps to try and understand why they existed. These may be legacy concepts, gone on the full release. But it was interesting and added a level of bizarre mystique that left me to retravel the game’s path once I had seen an ending, in search of something more. And that appeal to go back despite the games flaws says something more than I can put into words."
4603,256,Shattered - Tale of the Forgotten King,70,Jeuxvideo.com,"Feb 17, 2021","The biggest criticism that we can make to the title, it is its battles, rigid and imprecise when it is necessary to destroy the basic enemies (of which the bestiary is not very large), which you will have ample opportunity - or even the obligation - to do during your game, Shattered based like his fathers on a system of souls to be collected to improve his character."
4604,256,Shattered - Tale of the Forgotten King,65,RPG Fan,"Mar 29, 2021","I really wanted to like Shattered – Tale of the Forgotten King, and there are definitely aspects of this game that are praiseworthy, but it wore me down through the constant repetition of fighting the same enemies with the same tactics and the frequent feeling of not knowing where exactly I was or where I was supposed to go. I’m sure there’s more to discover than I did by the time I found my way to a bad ending and the closing credits, but I don’t think I’ll be able to bring myself to dive back in and uncover it."
4605,256,Shattered - Tale of the Forgotten King,65,PC Invasion,"Feb 17, 2021","Simultaneously engrossing while desperately in need of focus and polish, Shattered is a hard game to recommend in its current state.

4606,256,Shattered - Tale of the Forgotten King,60,Checkpoint Gaming,"May 29, 2021","Shattered – Tale of the Forgotten King has so many things going for it. It looks absolutely stunning with its protagonist filled with jagged edges, its melancholic soundtrack with its twangy acoustic guitars, and the story behind its creation is super sweet and inspiring. However, this is a game that has been in early access for nearly two years. Steam is full of players offering suggestions in their reviews of what needs improving, but a lot of these repeated suggestions have not been taken on. Shattered needed to be worked on a bit more before it was smashed into pieces and served up to its audience."

At this point, I've played plenty of Soulslikes. The ones that I did enjoy tried to play around with the formula in some way. But Shattered doesn't reinvent the wheel or even try to gussy it up. It's just a so-so Soulslike that tries to stand out by having the same aesthetic as The Corpse Bride. And that's simply not enough."
4609,257,Edge Of Eternity,90,GameSpace,"Aug  9, 2021",The overall feel of the game is great and I would recommend it to any fan of the RPG genre. Some things seemed out of place for the type of RPGs I like to play but each person has their own preferences. Midgar Studio did a fantastic job of putting this title together.
4610,257,Edge Of Eternity,80,Hey Poor Player,"Jun  8, 2021","Edge of Eternity has not only met, but surpassed my expectations in every way imaginable. It goes beyond simply being a ""love letter to the classics"" and has the potential to eventually become one itself someday, given that it gets a little bit of polish here and there (which I've already heard that it will be receiving, at least in part). In a gaming landscape that seems to have largely given up on many of the more traditional JRPGs, it's nice to see that there are others out there who insist on keeping it alive—and it's encouraging to see that they have the means to see things through."

4612,257,Edge Of Eternity,75,ZTGD,"Jun  9, 2021","All in all, Edge of Eternity is a fun game. Aside from some weird facial animations, and some other jank I really enjoyed my time in the world. As I said before the world itself is quite beautiful and inviting; it really goes to show just how good Unreal 4 engine can be. I know we are all hyped to see the new U5 games, but the old version still looks great. If you are a fan of the JRPGs from the 90’s and early 00’s then Edge of Eternity is for you. It has just enough nostalgia to make you smile when thinking about those old memories, but enough current systems and features that make it really feel like a product that is the best of both worlds."
4613,257,Edge Of Eternity,75,PC Invasion,"Jun  8, 2021","Ambitious in size, scale, and scope, Edge of Eternity offers a somewhat enjoyable romp that could last you over 40 hours. Sadly, it's also very rough around the edges, and poor pacing can be detrimental to your experience."
4614,257,Edge Of Eternity,70,CD-Action,"Jul 23, 2021","The strongest point of this fantasy/sci-fi jRPG is definitely its very good turn-based combat capable of surprising you with creative encounters. The narrative has some memorable moments, but be aware that it is entirely linear. However, I do not condemn that decision, because it does suit the road movie-like story. What Edge of Eternity lacks the most is its own identity and the developers’ courage to do things their way instead of copying Final Fantasy and other Square titles. It could also use a better engine, more suitable for such a complex game. [08/2021, p.62]"
4615,257,Edge Of Eternity,70,Jeuxvideo.com,"Jul  9, 2021","Yes, the technical shortcomings are felt, especially in the animations and the expressions of the characters. But the Nîmes team, undoubtedly driven by the love of Japanese RPGs that shines through every pixel, has overcome some of the difficulties encountered. The studio aptly bet on artistic direction, music and dialogue, in addition to a host of elements that add substance to the gameplay, for a pleasant and complete video game experience, albeit of mixed quality."

4617,257,Edge Of Eternity,70,Hardcore Gamer,"Jun 11, 2021","Edge of Eternity is a love letter to classic Final Fantasy and Xenoblade games. It doesn’t live up to the level of its influences, but given the small team and limited resources, it’s an impressive attempt. The story does rely on tropes and the characters aren’t all that likeable, and while the game comes close to reaching its ambitious goals, it never reaches its full potential. It does scratch the JRPG itch and fans of the games that influenced it will likely get a lot of enjoyment from Edge of Eternity, but ultimately it’s a good but not great JRPG."
4618,257,Edge Of Eternity,70,TheSixthAxis,"Jun  8, 2021","Edge of Eternity is definitely a welcome addition to the JRPG pantheon, and while it clearly doesn’t have the budget of the genre giants, it is full of heart and character. I certainly enjoyed my time exploring Heryon, despite a few niggles and a crafting system that adds little. If you go into this with an open mind and have an affection for the genre, then you’ll find much to like."
4619,257,Edge Of Eternity,65,Wccftech,"Jul 12, 2021","Edge of Eternity aims for the stars and manages to reach a few of them, delivering a compelling plot and an expansive, varied, and often-beautiful world. Sadly, clunky dialogue, issues with exploration and combat, and a pervasive level of jankiness hold the game back. You have to admire Midgar Studio for pushing themselves, but as is, the Edge of Eternity may be too jagged for some."
4620,257,Edge Of Eternity,64,COGconnected,"Jun 16, 2021","Edge of Eternity is almost brilliant. The writing is great, but the graphics, gameplay, and especially the camera angles drag it down. If you crave some dark JRPG action and are willing to put with questionable combat mechanics, by all means, check it out. However, if you hate the idea of trying to plan out a strategy when you can’t see half the enemy forces or you get motion sick easily, maybe give this one a pass."
4621,257,Edge Of Eternity,60,Noisy Pixel,"Jun 10, 2021","Edge of Eternity is a beautiful game that is held back by the ambition of the developers. There are just too many moving parts here, and nothing seems to be fully executed. It’s by no means a waste of time, though, and provides hours of fantasy adventures in a new world, but it lacks focus and implementation due to the numerous features and broken narrative."
4622,257,Edge Of Eternity,60,Multiplayer.it,"Jun  8, 2021","The first impression remains for the duration of the game, and it is that the developers have wanted to take the longest step of the leg. The result is a decent Japanese role-playing game with obvious budget limits."

4624,257,Edge Of Eternity,50,Screen Rant,"Jun  8, 2021","Edge of Eternity is an ambitious game, but it doesn't quite live up to its scope. The game feels like a homage to the classic Final Fantasy games of old, but its enchanting world is let down by the lackluster events happening on its surface. The combat system and character customization are well-done, but they don't matter if there isn't a good reason to keep moving forward. While JRPG fans will likely find enough to like that its worth giving Edge of Eternity a shot, other players should seek more engaging options within the same genre."
4625,258,Disjunction,80,Screen Rant,"Jan 29, 2021","Disjunction is an effective cyberpunk stealth game. Its gameplay is crisp and rewarding, while its strong sprite design and excellent soundtrack help it capture the cyberpunk tone perfectly. For those after a genuine cyberpunk experience, this is a good place to go."
4626,258,Disjunction,80,The Indie Game Website,"Jan 29, 2021","The cyberpunk genre has gained a good game here with Disjunction. It’s at its best when you’re sneaking through futuristic offices and factories and trying to figure out which ability to use next. The action is a little lacklustre when stealth fails, and the story is enjoyable, but not world-changing. It’s definitely a pretty game though, and the light RPG help to keep things interesting as you play through it."
4627,258,Disjunction,80,PC Games,"Jan 28, 2021","Disjunction has motivating gameplay, an entertaining (albeit predictable) story and exciting characters. But by far the most impressive is the detailed and fascinating game world, about which I would like to see one or the other game or book. The few negative points are particularly quickly forgotten when we sneak from opponent to opponent with great concentration. Every Cyberpunk 2077 frustration is swept away."
4628,258,Disjunction,80,Noisy Pixel,"Jan 28, 2021","Disjunction is a tough but speedy stealth adventure that kept me thoroughly engaged. Character’s abilities, narrative choices, and more strategic elements really give players some interesting variety and options on how to approach gameplay. There are some questionable control choices,  but nothing that will hinder the experience. For those looking for a sneaky cybernetic stealth-adventure, Disjunction shouldn’t go unnoticed."

4631,258,Disjunction,70,GameByte,"Feb 19, 2021","Disjunction is a fun, cyberpunk stealth game, with beautiful pixel art and great sound that is more than worth its price tag. Be prepared for some difficult levels and many moments of frustration, but enjoy basking in the glory of your successes at the end, whilst you enjoy an intriguing story in a dystopian world."
4632,258,Disjunction,70,Impulsegamer,"Feb  8, 2021","As a debut from a team of just three people, Disjunction does so much right, and offers up way more narrative than anyone should expect from a team this size. The gameplay it does it have can be frustrating at times, but it’s solid. There’s a good foundation here. They just need to expand on it."
4633,258,Disjunction,70,GameSkinny,"Feb  8, 2021","Disjunction is a fun stealth action game with great art and music, but there aren't enough interesting elements to keep the gameplay from eventually growing stale. It is held back by a lack of interesting development in both gameplay and story, however, and overstays its welcome. This is a good first outing from a small development team that can’t quite live up to its legendary predecessors."
4634,258,Disjunction,70,Gamer Escape,"Feb  1, 2021","Disjunction offers a solid, fun take on the stealth action genre. While it stumbles at times with the feel of its stealth mechanics, it is still satisfying and fun to play, aside from the one time my game progress mysteriously got deleted and I had to start over (though it hasn’t happened again). If you enjoy action stealth experiences like those found in the early Metal Gear games and games like Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell (except being 2-D) and you like new retro-styled games in the modern era, chances are good you can enjoy this game, even if it doesn’t have the most realistic stealth mechanics."
4635,258,Disjunction,65,GamingTrend,"Feb  8, 2021","Slick, intuitive stealth gameplay serves as Disjunction’s backbone, though the supporting systems and level design could do more to lighten its burden."
4636,258,Disjunction,60,Riot Pixels,"Mar  1, 2021","Oversimplification is the real joykiller in Disjunction. Its story feels like a rough outline, levels are made out of copy/pasted prefabs, stealth and character progression are just as simplistic, as is everything else."
4637,258,Disjunction,60,EGM,"Jan 29, 2021","Disjunction deconstructs the stealth genre and boils it down to its simplest and most readable mechanics. Mix in a cool cyberpunk aesthetic and interesting if optional gadgets, and it’s a winning formula. Unfortunately, the game stops well short of fully mining either its trope-heavy story or stealth formula, leading to an experience that ultimately feels repetitive."
4638,258,Disjunction,50,IGN France,"Jan 28, 2021","Disjunction fills all the specifications of its genre but fail to master them. Without that little extra soul that would keep us going for hours, boredom settles pretty quickly."
4639,258,Disjunction,35,DualShockers,"Jan 28, 2021","Disjunction has so much potential — it has a great soundtrack, interesting ideas for combat, and a serviceable story. These are all bogged down by frustrating and imbalanced combat mechanics, unimaginative stealth, and plain visuals. Disjunction impressed me when I originally played it some time ago, but it may have benefitted from being bite-size. Taking in the entire game, I couldn’t help but want the experience to be over and done with."

4643,259,Alfred Hitchcock: Vertigo,75,MGG,"Dec 21, 2021","Alfred Hitchcock - Vertigo offers a worthy tribute to the master of anxiety. Not only does it respect the codes of the films of the time and provides us with a soundtrack at the height of its model, but it also relies on a perfectly crafted scenario, with numerous twists and turns that keep us on the edge of our seats. It's a pity that it suffers from a not always perfect technique, as well as an often disastrous lip animation. But if you are a fan of narrative games and Hitchcock's films, you should forgive this pitfall as the atmosphere is there and the flashbacks are appreciable."
4644,259,Alfred Hitchcock: Vertigo,65,Wccftech,"Jan  2, 2022","Alfred Hitchcock - Vertigo is an interesting narrative-driven adventure game, or more like an interactive story, which incorporates several themes from Hitchcock's work. While not linked to the film of the same name, Vertigo is similar in many ways and - like Vertigo - features a compelling and well-told story with (mostly) interesting and well-developed characters. However, this story is countered by distracting facial animation, issues with balancing the generally good audio, and other technical problems. Alfred Hitchcock - Vertigo isn't a bad interactive story, I'd even recommend the story, it misses the mark on too much for me to not offer some caution."
4645,259,Alfred Hitchcock: Vertigo,65,Jeuxvideo.com,"Dec 20, 2021",Alfred Hitchcock: Vertigo is an intriguing thriller if not breathtaking. Its common thread is woven through the mysteries that we are keen to unveil. But it suffers from such a slow pace that it can become heavy. The spectacle is also appreciated in half-tone; Pendulo Studios develops a conclusive sound atmosphere to the detriment of particularly lame animation and technique.
4646,259,Alfred Hitchcock: Vertigo,50,Adventure Gamers,"Jan  7, 2022","Whilst its exciting plot twists are sure to have you dizzy with surprise, Vertigo ultimately fails to stand up against the weight of expectation brought about by its own name."
4647,259,Alfred Hitchcock: Vertigo,50,Everyeye.it,"Dec 27, 2021","Translating the cinematographic language of a seminal director like Hitchcock into a video game is a complicated intent, and the way in which Pendulo Studio chased it underlines an obvious confusion about the very nature of the adaptation. Vertigo is all form and little content, and qualifies as a narrative adventure a la TellTale with very little to say, mostly due to the flatness of its tale. A great pity, unfortunately."

It’s a heartfelt game that will gift a smile to many players’ faces, while also delivering a strong message essential to our daily lives. Say yes to Say No! more."

4651,260,Say No! More,80,The Games Machine,"Apr 15, 2021","Say No! More is such a strange game it can barely be considered one: you just need to press the spacebar to get to the end (even if there’s a moment when you need to *not* press it and I almost got stuck). Despite this, it is indeed a funny game that smashes the “yes man” workaholic culture, and it does it under a beautiful SEGA-blue sky. Perfect if played after eight hours in the office."
4652,260,Say No! More,80,Softpedia,"Apr 12, 2021","Say No! More is an example of what a small team with a clear message and design direction can deliver. Studio Fizbin has crafted a short but happy game that explains why uttering a certain word is necessary and makes players feel powerful while saying it. I felt like a better human being after I finished it, even if it might not actually lead to more instances of “No” in my own life.
There’s a little bit too much earnestness in the writing at times, especially during the final third, but once one buys into the premise it is easy to get past it. Say No! More talks about the importance of choice and self-expression and curious players should ignore its thesis and say “Yes” to this narrative-driven experience."

When it comes to delivering an actual game, though, it falls flat, especially when it tries to create an illusion of any depth. Still, the writing alone, combined with its unique style, make this into a bizarre workplace tale you may want to hear, especially if you’re all too familiar with the awkwardness of the daily grind. Overall, maybe it doesn’t deserve the most enthusiastic “Yes!” but you shouldn’t say “No!” to this game either."

It's fun when you master it and has all the elements of the original Alex Kidd in Miracle World from the SEGA Master System. The differences with that game, outside of the aesthetic section, are minimal, that is why, in essence, it is the same 8-bit game from 35 years ago, with linear levels, limited lives and instant death.

4674,262,The Gunk,75,SECTOR.sk,"Jan 24, 2022","The Gunk is a little-big surprise. It is an unconventional platforming game with puzzle elements and interesting gameplay aspects. It offers a strange world, fun game mechanics, although it doesn't have many fights and its story is a bit clumsy."
4675,262,The Gunk,75,Softpedia,"Jan 10, 2022","The Gunk is a game that does a decent job of offering ideas that other titles have explored in better ways. The gameplay is fun at first barely evolves. The story, especially the interactions between Becks and Rani, is decent but has nothing especially memorable to offer. The game has everything it needs for some cool cooperative play moments but does not offer those mechanics."
4676,262,The Gunk,75,Worth Playing,"Dec 20, 2021","It doesn't hit the highs of the SteamWorld series, but The Gunk is enjoyable. When you break things down, the game doesn't offer up a plethora of things to do, but it remains enjoyable thanks to how satisfying it is to clean up gunk. There's payoff for the curious in the form of extra materials to power up your arm faster, and even though it is familiar, the story remains satisfying. Its short length makes it perfect for the Game Pass service, but it is also a worthy purchase if you like brisk, uncomplicated adventures."

mechanics. It can be completed on a cozy evening."
4678,262,The Gunk,70,PC Games,"Jan 11, 2022",The Gunk is a wonderful game about good friends Rani and Beck. They have a small scavening business and harvest resources in order to sell them. The fascinating story begins as soon as you land on a planet full of disgusting gunk. Once you cleared it up you can see the fantastic and colorful world that is hidden underneath the slime. Soon they even found signs of an ancient civilization. They realized that they have to discover the secret of the colorful planet in order to remove the gunk and save the former inhabitants from the threat.
4679,262,The Gunk,70,TrueGaming,"Dec 19, 2021","The Gunk is a visually appealing game that has its moments, but it lacks the innovation and challenge to leave an everlasting impression."
4680,262,The Gunk,70,Checkpoint Gaming,"Dec 19, 2021","I really, really enjoyed my time with The Gunk; a fleetingly brief experience that left me feeling tranquil and at peace. It is rare a game can have an effect like that on me – what with the smorgasbord of violent games and intensity on offer around every corner. Do not let the quirky name put you off, The Gunk is more than deserving of a play during a lazy summer (or winter for you northern hemisphere dwelling folk) afternoon. Bugs and minor flaws do prove to be an inconvenience, although Image & Form Games have still managed to deliver a solid 3D platformer that’s worth a look."
4681,262,The Gunk,70,IGN,"Dec 16, 2021",The Gunk is a simple little platforming adventure full of malicious messes that are plenty fun to clean up.
4682,262,The Gunk,70,Hardcore Gamer,"Dec 16, 2021","There’s a lot to love about The Gunk even if the core gameplay rarely rises above being pretty OK.  It’s a good adventure through a unique and pretty alien world, filled with character and life.  Rani and Beck are a good team and their dialogue is great fun, even as the pressures mount on their relationship.  The story of the alien civilization makes sense, and it’s good to play a game where the mysteries have clear solutions rather than get lost in heavy-handed world building.  If the platforming and combat had lived up to everything else then The Gunk would be top-tier gaming, but even so it ends up being a playable adventure that will keep you invested to the final credit roll."
4683,262,The Gunk,67,New Game Network,"Jan  3, 2022","There is nothing special or complicated about The Gunk, but it proves to be a relaxing and light adventure that focuses on the manual removal of a toxic substance and the abrupt return of nature."
4684,262,The Gunk,65,Jeuxvideo.com,"Dec 17, 2021","More seductive in its first part, The Gunk offers a pleasant exploration in sumptuous settings which lose their luster a little over the course of the journey; it also fails to renew itself in the challenges and puzzles it houses. This short adventure of 6 to 7 hours only is appreciated in the tranquility of its experience, its narrative potential and its beautiful dubbing. But difficult to be fully excited after spending long hours sucking up to abundant parasites."
4685,262,The Gunk,62,Wccftech,"Dec 19, 2021","The Gunk is a rather visually stunning experience with many drawbacks that prevent it from scoring higher. While it has some noteworthy high points, it also has some devastatingly low points that show that Image & Form Games are just dipping their toes into 3D world design."
4686,262,The Gunk,60,GamesRadar+,"Dec 16, 2021","Rani and Becks are an appealing duo to share adventures with, but they deserve something more exciting than The Gunk has to offer."
4687,262,The Gunk,50,App Trigger,"Dec 16, 2021","The environments are gorgeous and the game runs smoothly across all platforms, but uninspiring gameplay and a lackluster story leave much to be desired in this entirely mediocre action-adventure platformer."
4688,262,The Gunk,40,TheGamer,"Dec 17, 2021","The Gunk is not a disastrous game. I enjoyed turning my brain off for five hours and exploring this strange and mysterious planet. It’s okay for games to just be empty calories sometimes, and I wouldn’t knock The Gunk for just being a generic popcorn flick. The Gunk aspires to be more than that though, and it falls considerably short. The quality of the SteamWorld games gavethe expectation that this would be a fresh take on the third-person adventure genre, but The Gunk is too shallow for me to recommend - even in the slow December months. If you’re looking for character-driven action-adventure games on Game Pass, Lake and Firewatch were both added earlier this week. Give those a look and leave The Gunk in the gutter."

4691,263,Nerve,70,Hardcore Gamer,"Feb 17, 2021","While it’s a game that says little — and in the end won’t stand out as immensely as some of the greats of both the rhythm and runner sub-genres — what NERVE lacks in unique identity, it makes up for with a campaign housing a difficulty curve that’s both well-balanced and creatively cunning."
4692,263,Nerve,70,Attack of the Fanboy,"Feb 17, 2021","A small helping of issues are not enough to derail Nerve, though they do keep it from greatness. What's on offer is worth playing if you're a fan of games that encourage ""one more attempt"", though there will be moments you'll walk away more annoyed than satisfied. The lurid, psychedelic art style and pumping soundtrack nearly elevate Nerve to similar heights as its inspirations, but it'll need a little more tuning under the hood before it reaches those same lofty precipices."
4693,263,Nerve,65,New Game Network,"Feb 23, 2021","Nerve has some interesting ideas, but its admittedly unique mix of roguelike elements, speed, and strategy doesn't always produce satisfying results."
4694,263,Nerve,60,DarkStation,"Feb 24, 2021","Nerve is certainly a rollercoaster of an experience, more so than most titles. It is genuinely exhilarating when you fully master a level and move at top speed from the beginning to the end. However, the lengthy memorization process and saturation of visual effects made the lows exceedingly difficult to bear. The narrow focus on exclusively being a hardcore experience left me divided as I found it difficult to play for extended periods of time without getting overburdened by the fast flashing lights and unsatisfying, tedious practice phases. I can only recommend the game to those that are absolutely in love with the idea of a punishing, fast paced title with some of highest highs and lowest lows within the medium."
4695,263,Nerve,50,Screen Rant,"Feb 16, 2021","Nerve has a great concept and it both looks and sounds amazing. It's a game that is designed for speedrunners and people who love memorizing entire stages worth of hazards. Nerve will definitely appeal to a niche group (especially once its technical issues are fixed), but the frustration outweighs the fun on too many occasions to make it a recommendation for most."
4696,264,Shadow Man: Remastered,90,ZTGD,"May 12, 2021","Shadow Man Remastered is a great game and I hope those with fond memories enjoy it as much I do. I hope those unfamiliar will give this a shot as well because while this is a game from the 90s it feels very modern in the controls. A simple walkthrough will help stop any unnecessary wandering and backtracking is necessary for completion so I say use that walkthrough guilt free. For $20 there’s a lot of game here, so skip the basic port Nightdive previously put out and do not buy the old console versions because they cost close to $20 and they don’t run as well. This is the definitive version of Shadow Man and I hope that maybe… just maybe… Nightdive figures out how to remaster Shadow Man: 2econd Coming (and fix its horrible title)."
4697,264,Shadow Man: Remastered,80,Meristation,"Jan 30, 2022","Nightdive Studios have done a great job remastering this classic.  Thanks to this new version, Shadow Man looks, sounds and plays better than ever."
4698,264,Shadow Man: Remastered,80,COGconnected,"Jan 28, 2022","The most satisfying thing about this remaster is the charm of the original game is still present. This version of Shadow Man is the best of both worlds. This is an excellent marriage of old-time gaming with a fresh coat of technical polish. If you’ve never played this game before, you are in for a treat."
4699,264,Shadow Man: Remastered,75,Destructoid,"Apr 25, 2021","What it comes down to is that Shadow Man Remastered is an excellent title that I enjoyed thoroughly. However, it is an excellent twenty-something-year-old title, and some people just can’t go back to that era. I get it. But for the rest of us, this is definitely a title worth pulling back from Deadside."
4700,264,Shadow Man: Remastered,75,KeenGamer,"Apr 21, 2021","Shadow Man Remastered is a great improvement to the game. Nightdive Studios crammed in a bunch of cut content from the original. This includes three huge new levels, enemies, some voice dialog and more. The soundtrack is remastered for better sound quality, and all textures were redone in higher definition. You can also play using the original low-res textures if you want. Nightdive Studios is listening to the community as it fix things for the first major update, including a few things that weren't ready for launch day, like the Seraph Queen boss. Overall, this is a great remaster for a cheap price."
4701,264,Shadow Man: Remastered,70,GameCritics,"Jun 23, 2021","Shadow Man: Remastered is an interesting choice for today’s market, because it’s not afraid to show the passage of time — it proudly displays the trappings of its era with untouched (and cryptic) level design, clunky combat and alight narrative. It will provide a particular sort of nostalgia for those who remember the period it’s from, but players coming to it for the first time should scale back any expectations."
4702,264,Shadow Man: Remastered,70,Multiplayer.it,"May  4, 2021","The remastered version of Shadow Man will undoubtedly capture the attention of Mike LeRoi fans, forced until now to compromise with archaic controls and resolutions unsuitable for modern systems."
4703,264,Shadow Man: Remastered,65,CD-Action,"Nov 19, 2021","If you remember the original Shadow Man, the remastered version might be a cool sentimental journey into the past. New players however will probably be discouraged by both the graphics and the terribly aged gameplay. [06/2021, p.53]"
4704,264,Shadow Man: Remastered,60,TheGamer,"Apr 29, 2021","It's interesting to get a look into the past that's as well cared for and presented as Shadow Man Remastered. Maybe I didn't find a new favorite, but there's no reason why you might not end up loving this. If you're okay with having a walkthrough ready and are willing to traipse through the same few corridors numerous times, Shadow Man is certainly a good way to kill some time between big releases."
4705,264,Shadow Man: Remastered,60,4Players.de,"Apr 21, 2021","The archaic action-adventure feels a bit outdated. Nonetheless, little changes as well as the unique atmosphere make sure there is enough fascination and exploring ambition left."
4706,264,Shadow Man: Remastered,55,Noisy Pixel,"Apr 19, 2021","To truly do this game justice, mechanics needed to be updated to make the overall experience more enjoyable. Faster pace and more fluid gun gameplay could bring new audiences. The game should be played by anyone who has never experienced the series and are interested enough to visit the Darkside themselves. I’m sure longtime fans will feel that nostalgic love, playing this occult hit exactly as it was published two decades ago but personally, I feel it could have been left on the shelf."

4708,264,Shadow Man: Remastered,50,Cubed3,"May 19, 2021","What is Shadow Man Remastered? It's a great remaster, of a not so great game. A tedious collect-a-thon wrapped in fancy horror-themed paper. It isn't really that fun, and not just because of its age, as, in all honesty, it wasn't that enjoyable to begin with. Despite being quite the sleeper hit of its era, it's an action-adventure whose overstretched length, and aggravatingly labyrinthine structure won't be appreciated by everyone, especially modern gamers. If still curious to try Shadow Man out, do purchase Nightdive's version, though, as it is undoubtedly the definite one."
4709,264,Shadow Man: Remastered,40,WellPlayed,"Apr 26, 2021","This hellish remaster is stretched to raw, fibrous sinews. There is far too little variety in the weapons and enemies to make the many hour stretches of blind backtracking and incomprehensible connected-world layout anything more than a slightly dressed up chimera’s corpse. Place this in video game museums with its cult mantle and a sign above its polished noggin that reads ‘look, don’t touch’."

4715,265,Siege Survival: Gloria Victis,70,Hey Poor Player,"May 17, 2021","Siege Survival: Gloria Victis is a thoroughly brutal mix of simulation and roguelike. It’s only for those who want an unforgiving experience and are happy to labour not for a glorious kingdom, but for one more day of desperate survival.

I know you guys are out there. I’m one of those people. And despite my many criticisms of the game, I intend to keep playing it after this review has gone live. That’s not necessarily always the case! But there is a spark of something at the core of Siege Survival: Gloria Victis. It’s a puzzle, and if I can just line all the pieces up, I know I’ll feel the satisfaction of solving a difficult gaming challenge. But I will not be able to help imagining the game this could have been; brighter, sleeker, and more imaginative."

4720,265,Siege Survival: Gloria Victis,50,PC Invasion,"May 17, 2021","Siege Survival: Gloria Victis has several mechanics and concepts that look good on paper. Unfortunately, general clunkiness when it comes to the UI and controls, as well as a lack of attachment to your characters, lead to a rather uninspired romp.

4721,266,City of Gangsters,90,Hooked Gamers,"Aug 31, 2021","Folks, City of Gangsters is a very well thought out and developed game. It's very detailed and quite comprehensive and to the point that most everything you could think of when thinking about booze running crooks is there. The developers definitely did the work and research necessary to show what prohibition was like back in the 1920s. Throw in a good measure of fun along with your bottle of moon shine and you will have hours of fun, just like I did some twenty-odd years ago with the Railroad Tycoon games that I loved so much. Don't drink too much of that white lightning because the cops could be pounding on your door next. Just make sure they are on the take like the cops in City of Gangsters are and you should be OK!"

It's as if City of Gangsters is ashamed about its administrative predilections, as if it wants to hide the true nature of its operation behind a less reputable -- more exciting, more dangerous -- veneer. City of Gangsters is itself a front; in the back room there resides a serious tycoon management sim. Like a reverse mullet, it's all party at the front and business at the back. It shouldn't be embarrassed about the mullet though. City of Logistics Managers is an excellent game, even if it may not be the one you're anticipating."

It can get repetitive during certain stages of expansion as you have the same interactions over and over, but if you can get over that then it’s pretty compelling. There’s an irresistible one-more-turn appeal that’ll keep you greasing palms and bootlegging hooch long into the night."
4725,266,City of Gangsters,70,COGconnected,"Aug  9, 2021","Overall, City of Gangsters is a fine title that attempts some fun twists on the 4X genre. The setting is excellent, the art is good, and the music is atmospheric. It would have benefitted from a little voice acting, especially in the tutorials, as this game has a lot of text to read. City of Gangsters demonstrates that the 4x genre works just as well in miniature as it does in grand, sweeping epic spans of history."

At its core, it is a long and unexciting game. A lot of the time I felt like I was trying to decode the game’s logic and keep plates spinning rather than run a successful bootlegging operation. When everything clicks, it can be somewhat satisfying, but that happens so rarely, you’d think the game was sampling its own wares."
4729,267,Into the Pit,80,Hardcore Gamer,"Oct 18, 2021","While the start of Into the Pit is unquestionably rocky, the follow-through is a blast, with fast action and serious pyrokinetics as monsters turn into blood splats decorating the walls.  While the overall theme could have been dark and gloomy, everything lights up and the darkness becomes the backdrop for the neon-magical lightshow to illuminate.  The variety of enemies and level types helps each run stay engaging, and while fifteen sets of levels plus the final area can feel like a bit much, there’s no need to try to blow through it all in a couple of days.  Into the Pit is about action, after all, with only just enough story to get things moving.  There’s a village in trouble and a ton of monsters to destroy by way of magical annihilation, and if it takes a bit to rescue everyone they’ll be fine waiting for a combat mage to do a run or two a day until the evil is finally dispelled."
4730,267,Into the Pit,70,The Indie Game Website,"Oct 18, 2021","I like Into the Pit a fair bit. The graphical style is nice, the combat is incredibly fluid, and the mechanics there are easy to understand, but also have a noticeable effect when spawning new dungeons. However, I also found it to be a little bit too easy for the most part. The game requires a lot of runs in order to rescue more villagers and max out your character, and it doesn’t do quite enough to keep you drawn in versus other similar games."
4731,267,Into the Pit,68,Multiplayer.it,"Oct 31, 2021","Into the Pit is a good roguelite, with some interesting elements added to the pot. A poor polishing and the repetitive nature of its gameplay prevent the game to shine nor impress has it could have."
4732,267,Into the Pit,67,COGconnected,"Nov  1, 2021","It’s a fast paced shooter, that feels really tight as a first person shooter. It’s meant to be played in fast bursts, so maybe it’s the perfect exciting thing to get you pumped while commuting on the bus. Or the kind of game where you breeze through the dialogue, turn off the sound and play while listening to a 25 hour audiobook. Into the Pit is a well-constructed roguelike shooting game and if you’re the kind of person who hears those words and yells, “I’m sold!” then you will probably have a lot of fun. But it’s not going to make believers out of genre-skeptics."
4733,267,Into the Pit,65,GameCritics,"Dec 14, 2021","I have a great fondness for roguelikes, but this one puts me in a weird place. Mechanically, Into The Pit is a welcome throwback to classic FPS games with the added twist of randomized elements to keep things interesting. However, the pool of random elements is too shallow and there are not enough interesting combinations to keep all but the most dedicated players interested."
4734,267,Into the Pit,65,Noisy Pixel,"Oct 18, 2021","It’s no doubt that Into the Pit draws heavy influence from the Doom franchise, with its old-school graphics, fast-paced shooting, and rock and roll heavy background music, but the core gameplay loop makes it hard to recommend as a rogue-like. It’s fully functional and fluid with snippets of fun thanks to its brief runs, but its lack of variation for dungeons, weapons, and bosses makes it difficult to stand out from others in the genre."

4737,267,Into the Pit,60,Screen Rant,"Oct 18, 2021","Into The Pit rolls out new content far too slowly. With player upgrades that are mostly changing numbers around and rooms that aren't hard to puzzle out, playing becomes an exercise in enduring repeated content before finally stumbling onto something that makes things feel fresh. Even then, what does unlock often isn't enough to truly fuel more runs. At the end of the day, Into The Pit is too repetitive to truly succeed as a roguelike and too skim on content to survive as an FPS without those trappings."

The open-world setting feels unique amongst other postapocalyptic titles, especially with humans being replaced by cute yet realistic-looking fuzzy animals. The world looks gorgeous but offers a ton of stuff to do with a wide variety to boot. The fighting is fluid and excellent, no matter if you're using special powers or normal weapons, and the flexibility of many of the game's elements gives it a ton of freedom compared to its contemporaries. Even in a month crowded with some legitimate heavy hitters, Biomutant is well worth playing for those looking for a good RPG."

And how over the span of an average twenty-or-so hour single-run it comes out not just unscathed, but victorious. Experiment 101 finding a way to incorporate the surreal and the strange, yet maintaining a consistent thread wherein the gameplay loop is both satisfying and intriguing to engage with. All of this, despite such continued reveling in its own eccentricity. But it’s that very eccentric attitude that marks Biomutant down as an unmistakably curious, but more importantly, entertaining open-world adventure to lose one’s self in."

It is difficult, it is true, to concretize these different aspects and to merge them. The fact remains that this experience, equal to no other, changes, surprises, and throws off to the point of becoming memorable.

However, given that combat plays such a huge part of the game, the rather middling nature of it makes fights feel like inconveniences, rather than something to enjoy."

I don’t think you can call a game bold enough to mix so many influences together safe, but there’s a distinct sense Experiment 101 came close to playing it safe. Whether from budget restraints, time restrictions, or COVID impacts, I don’t know, but Biomutant needs a sequel or DLC to make the most out of the strong foundation already present."

Even if its open world is indeed interesting, Biomutant has some clear issues such as a lack of variety in the enemies department, a repetitive gameplay, a progression system with not much to offer and a poor narrative that, in the long run, hurts the general gameplay. However, it manages to still stand throughout all this due to its less than 20 hours duration as well as its magnificent visual aspect, although in the end it simply provides an experience that probably won't stand out much... for better or worse."

A muddle of open-world cliches and a confused narrative bog down what could be a fun breezy experience. Combat needs tightening up to be truly satisfying, but currently feels weightless...Despite this the personality of the world, its creatures and the ability to craft your own gear and weapons shoulder a lot of the negative weight, and serve to colour a world that’s fun to explore even as its mechanical constituents and resolution are lacking."

The game has a very good match presentation and some solid club-focused mechanics but I am not sure that this is enough to make it a contender. The developers really need to get at least one major league full license (the Bundesliga is probably the most accessible) to draw fans in. An editor that is both faster and easier to use just to engage with names would also help. The football management space needs more options and more innovation. The developers clearly try to focus on the match and the squad interactions while also offering more club-based features for those who want it.

Unfortunately, the game not only fails to rise to its inspirations but seems to pull from them without an understanding of why they worked in the first place.

Apart from that, it overwhelmed me with the amount of useless junk you hoard in your inventory (I didn’t use most of the items even once), and disappointed me with uninteresting puzzles.

This new expansion ups the challenge, but at the cost of repeated mission types. The narration steals the show throughout every moment of gameplay. Now, you can add conspiracies and bull shark facts to the useless knowledge Maneater has taught us, and yet, I’m all here for it."

Although what slightly mars my experience was the several Unreal Engine crashes I experienced during gameplay and one of these crashes actually created a soft lock which I cannot recover because of my reliance on the game’s auto save system. So while my Truth Quest Progress will never reach 100%, I can only hope other players will not have completion slip from their grasp. At the price of $14.99, Maneater: Truth Quest is a good extension to the Maneater experience and for those inclined…it’s out there."

And while the new setting and commentary on the ridiculousness of internet conspiracy theories work well, the gameplay doesn’t feel like a cohesive part of the narrative. In Maneater, you had a tried-and-true tale of revenge with exciting twists and a satisfying conclusion. Truth Quest certainly offers witty writing and flawless narration. It’s just a shame that they almost feel wasted without meaningful missions to support them. Despite these issues, Maneater: Truth Quest still manages to dredge up more of what kept the base game so addicting. Upgrading your shark into a radioactive killing machine is hugely entertaining. And the new bounty hunter missions and apex hunts are fun and deliver a meaty challenge to those eager to dip their fins back in the water."

Unfortunately, it’s buried under even more mindless quests in a repetitive RPG that really didn’t need more of them. The cool new atomic powers, amusing dialogue from the narrator, and excellent final boss are highlights, but are barely enough to make the rest of this return to Maneater’s seas worth your while."

Westhaven is an entertaining narrator but his over the top conspiracy theories just aren’t as entertaining as his documentary narration in the base game. The new missions end up falling into the same type of repetition the other missions. The new atomic shark powers are actually one of the better parts of the expansion and having a green nuclear energy ball fly from a tail whip attack was a great addition. While taking on the new sea life monstrosities provided an enjoyable challenge, Truth Quest is a necessary reason to return to the water for only the most devoted Maneater fans."

It’s a meditative, peaceful experience that I’m sure will resonate with many others as much as it did with me.

It employs an interesting and underutilized mechanic, only to completely change it up once the main character achieves some desperately needed personal growth. It may require a second playthrough to totally understand not only the big reveal but overarching message; luckily, it’s a three hour excursion (at most) across bucolic English countryside, so that extra time is time well spent. If you find yourself exhausted by constantly trying to check things off life’s list, you deserve a breather — grab a metal detector and take a walk with The Magnificent Trufflepigs."

At best, the gameplay teased me with what could have been. At its worst, it was a frustrating and laborious mess. Storywise, there were few sparks of interest to be found. Should something catch alight, it would be quickly smothered by boring office chatter. It’s the purest form of a game that presents itself as a well-designed art piece.

After spending eight or so hours completing the story I have little compulsion to come back and check off all the things I didn’t get to on the map – after all, that stuff wasn’t particularly compelling in Immortals Fenyx Rising, and given that Myths of the Eastern Realm does precious little to change things up, it’s not particularly compelling here either."

Bad News For Hedgehogs!

HIGH It’s somewhat nice to see Zool back in his original form…

LOW …which reminds me it wasn’t that great to start with.

WTF The bleeding banana will haunt my dreams for years to come.

Back in 1992, the release of the original Sonic The Hedegehog drastically changed the gaming landscape. Suddenly, every software house wanted to work on a fast-paced 2D platformer and create its own mascot — an issue that especially preoccupied developers for home computers like the Commodore Amiga. Following this trend, Gremlin Graphics released the original version of Zool in 1992.

The titular ninja from the Nth Dimension crash-lands on an unfamiliar planet and will have to get through various obstacles to escape. While it may be a title that some gamers of a certain age may feel a bit of nostalgia for, the original Zool (along with a conversion for every console imaginable at the time) reveals just how important the level design was in making the Sonic games so memorable and appreciated. Unfortunately, Zool just doesn’t stack up.


As it’s now 2021, Zool has received a facelift. This version is the original platformer with a difficulty rebalance, a CRT graphics filter for added fidelity to the original and a zoomed-out view to allow the player see more of the screen. Overall, these changes make Zool a more approachable experience than it used to be, but they do not improve it on a fundamental level.

Each level in Zool lasts no more than a couple of minutes, and it’s time usually spent jumping from platform to platform or finding one’s way through the lower sections that require defeating enemies by shooting or jumping/gliding into them. This is a simple flavor of 2D platforming that feels inherently ’90s, and no filter can change that. Also, the end-of-stage bosses are pretty forgettable, some of which I defeated on my first try.


Redimensioned comes in two flavors which mainly act as difficulty — the original experience and the Ultimate Ninja mode. I would recommend most ’90s players to try the latter, as I finished the original with 15 lives to spare and never had a problem in most levels.

After completing seven stages and thirty-something levels, the Zool Redimensioned experience is basically over and done with. The changes made to ths version were well thought-out, but they do little to hide the fact that the original material was just an okay-at-best ’90s platformer and the intervening years haven’t done it any favors in terms of game design or graphics. Those who have nostalgia for it should check it out — all others should give it a pass."
4909,276,Zool Redimensioned,60,Finger Guns,"Aug 27, 2021","I’d still love to know what conversations took place that led to “hey, we should remaster Zool”, but Zool Redimensioned does a pretty decent job of applying a fresh coat of paint, but in a way that remains very reverent to the source material. An excellent achievement from a group that only started programming 12 months ago. Unfortunately, the source material itself is the ultimate problem here – Zool was an average game back in 1992 and it’s little more than average here in 2021. A pleasant nostalgia trip, yes, but sadly it’s offers nothing to compete with the best modern platformers."
4910,276,Zool Redimensioned,60,PC Invasion,"Aug 19, 2021","Though a noble effort, the transition to HD has probably done more harm than good. Challenging gameplay has been replaced with a virtual walk in the park, devoid of damn near any difficulty. If you're looking to relive gaming's past, this one may be better found in the original."
4911,276,Zool Redimensioned,60,Hey Poor Player,"Aug 18, 2021","I can appreciate what Sumo Digital Academy set out to do with Zool Redimensioned. It’s a solid remake of a platformer which, while not as well remembered as the titles from which it takes its inspiration, has its own place in the annals of video game history. The updated mechanics and quality of life features are great. Furthermore, with two modes to master, existing series fans will surely get their money’s worth. But as welcome as these additions are, they don’t do anything to remedy the issues that plagued the original release. With random stage designs and lackluster enemies and bosses, Zool just doesn’t do much to stand out from the crowded platformer pack. Still, if you already have a soft spot for the ninja from the Nth Dimension, don’t hesitate to add this one to your Steam library. If Zool didn’t do it for you before, however,  Zool Redimensioned isn’t going to change your mind."
4912,276,Zool Redimensioned,40,NME,"Aug 18, 2021","Zool Redimensioned is a valiant attempt to remaster a cult, old-school platformer in the 21st century, but the source material left the devs at Sumo Digital Academy very little to work with. Baffling design choices, a lack of any hook to keep you interested, and controls that never feel quite as satisfying as other platformers I’ve played mean I can’t see this version of the game gaining a cult following like it did in the ’90s."
4913,277,Thunder Tier One,80,Dexerto,"Dec  7, 2021","Thunder Tier One is an exciting tactical feast for both solo players and squads alike. There is some wonkiness to its AI, but its tense shooting mechanics and focus on information and visibility make it hard to overlook for fans of hardcore military shooters and tactics game experts alike. It’s not an easy mission, but it’s one you should definitely take on."
4914,277,Thunder Tier One,75,Digital Chumps,"Dec 15, 2021","Thunder Tier One is a good game. It has a decent amount of customization options, features a good tactical system that will entertain those looking for a tactical fix, and doesn’t really do anything groundbreaking or genre-changing for tactical shooters. It’s simply a good game with hopes for more content in the future."
4915,277,Thunder Tier One,72,The Games Machine,"Dec 24, 2021","The top-down tactical shooter Thunder Tier One offers a realistic and engaging singleplayer campaign, unfortunately ruined by AI partners who are too prone to ignore orders and cause havoc. The multiplayer is fun and shootouts are hectic, but there’s also a distinct lack of modes and the progression system isn’t too exciting. We don’t doubt Krafton will keep the game patched and updated though."
4916,277,Thunder Tier One,71,Riot Pixels,"Jan 22, 2022","Thunder Tier One has one very steep requirement if you want to enjoy it — it’s almost impossible to play it with random strangers. Find a good group, and the game will flourish."
4917,277,Thunder Tier One,70,Merlin'in Kazanı (Turkey),"Dec 29, 2021","Thunder Tier One is a production that has decided to fail of its own accord, while it will be successful in general terms."
4918,277,Thunder Tier One,65,Jeuxvideo.com,"Dec 22, 2021","In addition to the few inaccuracies of the aim or the artificial intelligence of the allies making solo progression quite delicate, it is for the moment by its lack of content that Thunder Tier One sins. By relying on the community to enrich the game with new maps and missions, KRAFTON Inc risks seeing its game falling into oblivion, which would be regrettable given the pleasure that can be taken in completing missions in cooperation, which will require tactics, communication and planning to be carried out “properly”. A real potential that is not yet fully exploited and that fans of this singular genre might find a little too thin."
4919,277,Thunder Tier One,60,Screen Rant,"Dec  7, 2021","While it does have its downsides when playing alone, Thunder Tier One is, overall, a solid wartime strategy game. It encourages its audience to contemplate their actions clearly instead of rushing in headfirst. The combat itself is rather simple - players point and click at enemies to trigger their weapon - but the sense of realism is impressive for the nine-mission campaign, and the ability to play the entire game with friends is a bonus."
4920,277,Thunder Tier One,60,NME,"Dec  7, 2021","Ultimately, Krafton has provided a solid foundation with good sound, mechanics, and control. However, it is missing a few things in its mission design to create a truly valuable experience. Of course, this game could see post-release content bolster its base components. The inclusion of modding tools from day one and a message from the devs calling Thunder Tier One “a playground for modding” shows the intent to create a platform for custom content to thrive. It just needs to be made now."

4923,278,Rustler,80,Gamer Escape,"Sep 14, 2021","If Rustler suffers from anything, it’s just that it sometimes doesn’t quite know what it’s trying to be. Most of the time, it seems to be specifically trying to parody GTA, and it plays a just like the early top-down games from said series. The tone is a bit off-beat, though, with all the jokes, pop culture, and poking of fun. It might not be perfectly cohesive, but whether you’re here for the jokes or because you like games where you can be on the wrong side of the law, there is definitely something here for you. So if you aren’t easily offended by the copious amounts of cursing, blood, and violence, you should definitely give Rustler a go. Pull that guard off his horse, ride off, and don’t look back!"

Soaked in pop-culture references, the game - which is translated into French - will appeal to any regular in the genre, but it arrives with its bundle of bugs and suffers from a bit too repetitive structure. Fortunately, its original universe and its pace make it possible to mitigate its shortcomings and one would almost come to hope for a more successful sequel. Because as it is, it is better not to be too picky to fully appreciate it."
4933,278,Rustler,50,Digital Chumps,"Sep 27, 2021","Rustler is a game that does a little of both but doesn’t commit to either idea enough to make an interesting experience. This indecision to commit hampers the game’s enjoyability and leaves players with a confused understanding of what the game wants to be. This compounded by a lack of black representation while directly referencing black culture everywhere, makes this game difficult to recommend."
4934,278,Rustler,50,PC Games,"Sep 12, 2021",Rustler copies ideas and mechanics of Grand Theft Auto 2 and tries desperately to squeeze them into a medieval setting.

The rollout of the narrative is appreciated, but this game does have a pacing problem. It doesn’t know if it wants to be a pick-up and play arcade firefighter game or a simulation time sink where most of the fun comes after multiple hours.

But in its current form, the mechanics are simply too limited to make the game engaging for more than a few hours. Its phone-based origin is clear. The big battles are, at first, fun and exciting. But the fourth or fifth time when almost the same scenarios appear it is hard to summon the energy to do it all again.

4961,281,Aragami 2,70,TheSixthAxis,"Sep 29, 2021","Aragami 2 is a huge departure from the original game. In exchanging the linear narrative-driven stealth experience for an open-ended co-op mission adventure, Lince Works has created a game that feels just as flawed as the original, but has a lot more charm in it's small moments and simplicity. Repetitive missions and enemies make it hard to get engrossed with the game for long periods of time, but as a stealth action game to hop into for quick little bursts, Aragami 2 can be pretty fun."
4962,281,Aragami 2,70,Areajugones,"Sep 21, 2021","Even if I know that my relationship with stealth titles is kind of 'toxic', Aragami 2 is but one more symptom of that link: I know that it has flaws, but I cannot avoid ignoring them in pursuit of their benefits. In the end, any criticism about its plot, its design or its technology succumbs to the simple but fundamental fact that it is satisfying and fun, leaving behind an experience that, without a doubt, I will fondly remember and recommend to any fan of the genre."
4963,281,Aragami 2,70,Gamer Escape,"Sep 20, 2021","For all my complaints, Aragami 2 does pull off making you feel like a ninja rather well. Planning just the perfect route to ambush everyone one by one or slip in and out without disturbing anyone felt really satisfying. It manages to tread that fine line of letting you get away with more than is realistic while still making a perfect run challenging that makes a great stealth game. I just can’t help but feel they took a few gambles with changing things up from the original, and took a step backwards as a result."

Add to this the many skills available to players, and the levels can be crossed with great ease for an exhilarating sensation. Unfortunately, the title suffers alongside a lack of variety which gives the feeling of always repeating the same levels over and over despite their large size and barely different objectives. We also regret the change of artistic direction for a result less captivating than in the first part and which reveals a fairly simple technique. Nonetheless, it remains a nice and effective infiltration game that will surely gain in depth thanks to its multiplayer mode."

While not everything is perfect, it’s hard to deny the comfort that comes from chilling in your boat, catching some crazy species of fish, and sailing around to take the blues away.

Moonglow Bay has been developed by a truly passionate team, one with so many great ideas that, in trying to implement them all, perhaps haven’t had the time or experience to flesh them out with the depth they truly deserve. Still, if the idea of saving a town through fishing sounds like your cup of tea, Moonglow Bay is worth checking out. Just be prepared for a rather simplistic ride."

The amount of progress that the game made in just a week and a single patch has given me nothing but hope for its future, and it’s a game I’ll be keeping an eye on in the weeks to come. Moonglow Bay also supports local coop, and while I’ll always support anything that allows me to play with friends, the game feels like an almost personal experience that I didn’t ever feel the urge to invite someone to share with me. So with that, I’ll leave you with my closing thoughts of Moonglow Bay: Not bad, cod be better."

Although it exists primarily as a training ground for multiplayer, the single-player campaign is worth playing, though it would have been even better with a true dramatic arc instead of the “infinitely replayable” roguelike runs. The three factions are a great place to start and whet the appetite for expansions and additional content."

Zine,"Sep  9, 2021","While the turn-based combat remained interesting and stayed true to its roots, and the units have a lot of variety, the newly implemented elements leave a lot to be desired. This coupled with some annoying bugs and an overall sense of an unfinished product make King’s Bounty II a very lackluster experience."
5037,285,King's Bounty II,60,IGN,"Sep  3, 2021",King's Bounty 2 is a fairly strong tactical RPG that is dragged down by a mediocre plot and a lot of unnecessary jogging.
5038,285,King's Bounty II,60,GRYOnline.pl,"Aug 27, 2021","Drastic changes to gameplay can be good, as proven by God of War. Unfortunately, King's Bounty 2 turns out merely an underwhelming experiment. In the past, we got a series of good tactical RPGs focused on combat, seasoned with some character building. Right now, we get a subpar imitation of The Witcher 3, where battles are just a minor addition."
5039,285,King's Bounty II,60,Checkpoint Gaming,"Aug 25, 2021","King’s Bounty II has all the ingredients of a great strategy game but is held back by a counterintuitive UI and generic story elements. While the overworld offers a beautiful open environment to explore, often there’s not enough there to hold your attention as a player, and you’ll find yourself wandering around aimlessly. Added to this is that your character’s travel is particularly slow, the game has a sleepy pace at times that holds the overall experience back. While its strategy battles feature some interesting ideal mechanics that might appeal to die-hard fans of the franchise, if you’re looking for a broad roleplaying strategy experience, King’s Bounty II might not be the best fit for you."
5040,285,King's Bounty II,60,PCGamesN,"Aug 24, 2021","1C Entertainment's attempt to reinvigorate the long-dormant series proves two things: its turn-based tactical combat is timeless, and making a compelling open-world experience is harder than it looks."
5041,285,King's Bounty II,59,PC Gamer,"Aug 23, 2021","But all that nice environment design is wasted by far too much wandering about, talking to people, and collecting trash to sell at vendors. Your character moves with a kind of halfhearted jog, too slow to cover ground, jerky, and unable to traverse any kind of obstacle. Meanwhile you can jump on your horse, which is much faster but handles like a stick of butter in narrow areas. It's all just kind of… slow and tedious to progress. Environments seem large simply for the sake of size. Much like the game's entire aesthetic, it's not really clear why things look the way they do."
5042,285,King's Bounty II,58,Player 2,"Sep  5, 2021","It is a case of close, but no cigar for King’s Bounty II. It makes a valiant attempt at creating an grand RPG but constantly trips over frustrating design choices."
5043,285,King's Bounty II,50,Games.cz,"Oct  4, 2021",King’s Bounty 2 offers solid battles of fantasy armies that can too often slide into frustration and inconsistency. Its world is beautiful but completely devoid of life and story. And the controls are simply awful.
5044,285,King's Bounty II,50,GameOver.gr,"Sep 10, 2021","King’s Bounty II attempts to mix together two different genres, but the outcome does not satisfy. Despite the somehow satisfactory battle system, it is evident that the game needed to follow a different approach during its development. What we have now is a mediocre title that leaves much to be desired."
5045,285,King's Bounty II,50,Everyeye.it,"Sep  9, 2021","King's Bounty II is composed of many traditional elements fused together in an unconventional way. Rather than melted it would be better to say stuck on top of each other. The amalgam of characteristics and genres is completely disorganized, confused, as if it were the mixture of randomly selected market trends. Taken individually, not all the constituent elements of the game are mediocre, indeed it is quite possible to be captured by the settings or by the combat system. But what is missing is the connection work: the most important operation in a complex product such as a video game. What distinguishes a good video game from a bad one is not the sum of the parts, it is how these parts interact with each other, how they contribute to the realization of a common goal."
5046,285,King's Bounty II,50,WellPlayed,"Sep  1, 2021","King's Bounty II is a well-meaning sequel that unfortunately lacks the character required to live up to its predecessors. Mediocre storytelling and shrug-inducing graphics and sound are partially redeemed by a decent combat system, albeit one without the courage to experiment."
5047,285,King's Bounty II,49,New Game Network,"Aug 31, 2021","A poor story, writing and performances coupled with outdated quest design make King's Bounty II a tough game to play through. Turn-based battles are enjoyable but can't make up for the game's numerous issues."
5048,285,King's Bounty II,45,GameWatcher,"Sep  3, 2021",King’s Bounty II is a game where it takes forever to do anything. I averaged maybe 2-3 short battles for every hour of gameplay – perhaps 20 minutes of fun for 40 of drudgery. All this is doubly frustrating because somewhere under all this crap is a pretty solid strategy game. I just wish that King’s Bounty II would stop jerking me around and just let me play it!
5049,285,King's Bounty II,40,Cubed3,"Nov  4, 2021","Tough game to rate overall, as there was some care and time that went into this; it just went to all the wrong places. Players looking for a strategy/tactical experience are going to be absolutely repulsed by the mix of ""walking sim""/WRPG that leaves much of the core experience behind absolutely. The battles are simplistic, and the few redeeming features are buried beneath too many complaints and issues. There is simply very little strategy in this game that occurs, or is interesting to think about."
5050,285,King's Bounty II,40,Gamer.no,"Aug 31, 2021","King's Bounty II is a disappointing RPG experience, doing very little to innovate, not really even managing to produce something that's fun or particularly exciting over time."
5051,285,King's Bounty II,40,Cultured Vultures,"Aug 23, 2021","Just like many of its undead characters, King’s Bounty 2 fails to revive a venerable franchise due to its lack of innovation, archaic design decisions, and grindy backtracking."

5054,286,Red Solstice 2: Survivors,72,The Games Machine,"Jun 21, 2021","Although I am convinced Red Solstice 2: Survivors will find its niche fanbase, I can’t really say the hybrid action/strategy gameplay impressed me. The single-player campaign is nice to have but it doesn’t stand out - the core experience here is definitely the multiplayer co-op."
5055,286,Red Solstice 2: Survivors,70,Jeuxvideo.com,"Jul 25, 2021","Although the whole remains a bit generic, both in its gameplay and narration compartments, Ironward provides us with most of what he wants us to experience: a good run-down of strange creatures, alone or with friends, against the background of the survival of the human species."
5056,286,Red Solstice 2: Survivors,70,GamingTrend,"Jun 28, 2021","With a focus on multiplayer, Red Solstice 2: Survivors tackles the action/tactical genre, offering up hordes of foes and beautiful presentations in the field. Where it lacks is connection with the player, bugs, and some difficulty spikes that make it infuriating."
5057,286,Red Solstice 2: Survivors,70,Eurogamer Italy,"Jun 28, 2021","Red Solstice 2: Survivors is an isometric and tactical TPS. It has a solid multiplayer and offers extensive customization options. Unfortunately, in single player, it tends to repeat itself."
5058,286,Red Solstice 2: Survivors,65,Wccftech,"Jun 30, 2021","Red Solstice 2: Survivors is, at best, a slightly above-average game. For every fun aspect, such as the genuinely fun action-packed nature of the run-and-gun gameplay, there are downsides such as incredibly repetitive missions outside of the core campaign. However, you then find an excellent range of creatures and a good amount of character customisation, really boosting the game, for it to then be let down by the base and region-building feeling tacked on, and then the game is impacted by a fair few bugs. If you liked the first Red Solstice, and other similar shooters, you'll enjoy this, though arguably in shorter sessions or with other people online."
5059,286,Red Solstice 2: Survivors,65,COGconnected,"Jun 28, 2021","Genre mashups like Red Solstice 2: Survivors can be refreshing and revelatory, or they can feel like a poorly seamed patchwork of ideas. Red Solstice 2 has some fun elements, occasionally engaging combat and systems, and a take on the Red Planet that is familiar but not entirely unoriginal. Poorly explained mechanics, lack of personality and ultimately repetitive mission design all push back against a more thoroughly enjoyable experience."
5060,286,Red Solstice 2: Survivors,65,GameCritics,"Jun 25, 2021","Red Solstice 2 is a bleak ordeal, but it’s not without its charms. There’s a real sense of frantic desperation created as the player scrambles desperately from one mission to the next, helplessly watching the global infection meter always climbing. Whether it’s zombie biomass, sinister corporations, or environmental catastrophe, for the entirety of Red Solstice 2′s play time I was sure that we were only ever a hair’s breadth away from extermination — which only served to make fighting against it feel all the more satisfying. If the developers could ease the repetitiveness from their random mission generator, this would be one of the best successors to XCOM’s legacy, but in its current state it’s just an extremely solid squad-based RTS."

One to keep an eye on if the premise appeals, but not worth diving into straight away."
5063,286,Red Solstice 2: Survivors,60,Checkpoint Gaming,"Jun 22, 2021","A niche but mostly well-presented experience, Red Solstice 2 attempts to create something entirely new by blending established genres. While its mishmash of strategy mechanics into an action game doesn’t quite hit the mark, it does provide a swathe of tense, tactical moment-to-moment gameplay and absolutely nails its occasional moments of creeping alien horror. It’s far from a strategy game at heart, and struggles to strike a balance between its complex real-time strategy mechanics and action-oriented gameplay – but for sci-fi fans who are prepared to overcome the game’s learning curve and just want to squad up and rip apart some eldritch abominations, there’ll eventually be plenty of gooey green blood to sink your grenades into."
5064,286,Red Solstice 2: Survivors,60,God is a Geek,"Jun 21, 2021","Red Solstice 2: Survivors is a decent game hindered by iffy AI, spiking difficulty, and a feeling of disconnect between player and game."
5065,286,Red Solstice 2: Survivors,60,Cultured Vultures,"Jun 17, 2021","While the multiplayer is where Red Solstice 2: Survivors shines, fundamental design clashes, lack of single-player focus, and poor information presentation make the game a highly inconsistent experience."
5066,286,Red Solstice 2: Survivors,50,PLAY! Zine,"Jul 10, 2021","Red Solstice 2: Survivors is a game that wants to be an RTS, Twin Stick shooter and
XCOM but does all three poorly. The game was clearly designed for 8 player co-op,
and it plays best in that way, but the solo, single-player campaign is not worth it. The
AI is troubling sometimes and the little control you have over your marines makes this
a dull experience."
5067,286,Red Solstice 2: Survivors,50,TheGamer,"Jun 20, 2021","If you enjoyed the first Red Solstice game, then perhaps this will be a satisfying sequel that continues the saga. But unless you got a bunch of buddies who are all itching to furiously click mutated aliens to death, you'll probably have a better time loading up another game of XCOM than trying to survive in the Martian wasteland of Red Solstice 2."
5068,287,An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs,80,KeenGamer,"May 26, 2021","An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs is a very comfy game, welcoming any weary traveler with open arms. The highlights of this experience are its sweet love story and the funny little conversations with the airport dogs. The sprawling stages will delight any explorer, but the actual transit and questing could potentially be tedious for some players. Still, its fantastic writing and its ambiance of pure fun make it a worthy experience for restless gamers - especially the dog-lovers."
5069,287,An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs,70,Adventure Gamers,"Sep  3, 2021","Though it lacks much in the way of interesting gameplay, An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs boasts hilarious dialogue and dark mysteries to uncover from its wonderfully diverse canine cast, and its ambiguous undertones are proof that not all dogs see things in black and white."
5070,287,An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs,70,The Indie Game Website,"Jun  7, 2021","Ultimately, what guides the trajectory of this voyage in Dog Airport is your relationship with Krista, which is surprisingly tender and heartwarming. It’s the contemplative, and sometimes mournful conversations you have with her, the reminiscing of older days, and the gentle banters you trade with one another, that makes every reunion with her a poignant.one. For a game that’s predominantly moulded in the surreal humor of the internet, I wasn’t expecting to be swept away by all these feels."
5071,287,An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs,70,TheSixthAxis,"May 25, 2021","It's hard to say how impressions of Dog Airport Game might have changed if we’d gotten the game outside of a pandemic, but it’s a lovely comedic slice of a forgotten time when air travel was normal. Just with tons of weird dogs and puns."
5072,287,An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs,65,GameCritics,"Jul 29, 2021","Recommending An Airport for Aliens Currently Run By Dogs depends a lot on one’s tolerance for backtracking and exploring huge areas with no map available. While the great wit and sheer absurdity of the situations managed tograb ahold of my interest, it wasn’t enough to keep me playing until the end."
5073,287,An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs,60,Edge Magazine,"Jun 17, 2021","Where other games treat romance as a reward or an optional curio, Airport dares to put love at its centre. For that, at least, it deserves praise. And a treat. Perhaps even a belly rub, too. [Issue#360, p.123]"
5074,287,An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs,60,Guardian,"Jun  2, 2021","Hang in there through the repetition, though, and it turns out that there’s more to this than internet dog jokes and fetch quests. The combination of wandering and postmodernism put me in a contemplative mood anyway, presumably by design, and the wistful conversations with Krista, in which the couple gently nurture a long-distance relationship, have tenderness and pathos that kept me coming back. As a joke game, this has the expected issues, but ultimately it’s a flight I’m glad I didn’t miss."
5075,287,An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs,50,GameSkinny,"May 25, 2021","There’s no use avoiding this fact: An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs is ultimately a meme game, though Strange Scaffolding has done an excellent job on the writing. Packing a brilliant sense of humor, that fact is only made more prominent by the deliberately low-effort presentation and enjoyable dialogue. However, those merits get significantly bogged down by tedious gameplay design, one where progression relies on endless fetch quests with little variety. You won’t need long to complete Dog Airport Game, which offers a four- to five-hour campaign, but if you plan on sticking it out, do so in short bursts."

It bleeds nostalgia, has a good roster of characters, and plays uniquely enough to stand on its own for casual and competitive players alike. The online portions are great when things are working.

Not very pretty, not always very precise, a little sparse in content, the dubbing of the original cartoons are absent ... However, the fighting game of Fair Play Labs exudes passion. We don't recommend it to everyone, as NASB is targeting a very specific niche. By mimicking the physics of Super Smash Bros. Melee and implementing one of its advanced techniques, this atypical brawler manages to seduce those nostalgic for the early 2000s. Those will see it as a good way to immerse themselves in the licenses of their childhood while by rediscovering familiar sensations and a solid competitive environment. Hopefully the studio's follow-up will be good, as Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is holding something."

Combat is pretty decent, but there’s just so little surrounding it. The game’s greatest sin is how little it leans into the over-the-top zaniness that is Nickelodeon and its extensive history of memorable characters and moments. It lacks identity while being based on some of the most unique entertainment properties of the past few decades."

But that’s not the case, and even though I did enjoy it for what it is, I can’t recommend it when the alternatives are so incredibly superior in its current state. I’m sure with a passionate team and a dedicated community it could do really well, but with a haemorrhaging player base and the blaring shortage of anything to keep people in the game in a world dominated by season passes and constant loot-box unlocks, I just don’t see that happening."

The cute characters and strong environments are coupled with a camera system that acts haywire anytime you're near an object. The forgiving respawn system becomes brutal when you return to a spot where you're near an object that is difficult to navigate around. The sometimes-dodgy collision detection can make some quests go on longer than they should.

From dirty cereal bowls to server cables, travelling across 5 different levels to help your human come home was enjoyable and engaging. Meeting several interesting and pun-filled birds who help you on your journey just added to the quirk and charm.

However, if you have the option, go with the PC version of the game, especially considering that the game is coming to Xbox Game Pass next month.

It’s just that there is so much dragging these charming elements down, the most noticeable of which is the actual skating and the physics involved with it.

I also believe it was possible to squeeze much more out of this darker twist on the Robin Hood setting. It is not an excellent game right now, but it is enjoyable enough to be addictive, and I’m looking forward to future updates, hoping they will unlock Hood’s full potential. [08/2021, p.76]"

The art and world design care are impeccable, representing a grim and gory version of the English folklore. It’s empowering to play as legendary vigilantes and decimate the establishment or opposing forces with strategy and stealth. Although, it doesn’t come without its fair share of problems. The winching mechanic, and currently the only objective type in the game, is unmistakeably frustrating and poorly conceived. Without a proper refresh of the goals, the community might take their gold elsewhere.

Those strategies need to be constantly challenged, though, instead of feeling like a to-do list each round. The introduction of a skill ranking system would also go a long way as playing with similarly skilled groups is like a whole different game than when completely crushing a team or getting grouped with those still learning the basics. I have high hopes for Hood. I’d love nothing more than to see a steady flow of engrossing changes to help build a solid community around it but I guess we’ll just have to wait and see."

It's different and often fun, and when it works, it works. The current experience is dampened by a lack of meaningful content and a few balancing issues that frustrated me to a point where I had to stop playing — but I always came back for occasional matches. If Sumo Digital manages to keep the momentum going with much-needed updates and additional content and if the community stays active, Hood could be a very fun multiplayer title across the board. Until then, I'll wait to see which direction Hood takes over the coming weeks."

The heist gameplay is best when you have a party of friends who communicate and coordinate the attack, allowing the multiplayer heavy game modes to provide much of the enjoyment. Still, there’s a lack of polish in this adventure, but more importantly, a lack of content. Adding new weapons, levels, collectibles, and challenges could add value to the experience.

Moreover, the catastrophic matchmaking doesn't help, and the infiltration aspect is quickly put aside because of the need to rush while not worrying about dying since you can come back as often as you want. If we add to this the lack of real character customization, guards who are not very attentive and approximative fights, it is not the graphics or the level design of the few proposed maps that will be enough to make up for it."

It’s a cyberpunk story that dives deep into the timeless question about whether freedom is worth sacrificing for peace and happiness, about whether freedom without peace is truly peace at all, and vice versa. A puzzle system built around navigating people’s memories using keywords turns the storytelling itself into part of the game in a fascinating way. But the full potential of gets lost in the brevity and abruptness of the experience; Don’t Forget Me is a compelling game full of unique ideas, but one that feels a little incomplete."

It’s a refreshing experience that encourages you to slow down for a minute and take the time to smell whatever it is that grows out there. And for SWERY fans, The Good Life feels like his most polished effort to date and probably a greater realization of what he had attempted to do with Deadly Premonition, at least in terms of free, exploratory gameplay."
5135,293,The Good Life,70,GameCritics,"Nov 29, 2021","Playing The Good Life can be a baffling experience. There’s a parade of weird characters, a constant stream of odd happenings, and a complete refusal on the game’s part to ever explain the whys of its biggest mysteries. I can’t pretend I wasn’t disappointed that things never came to a satisfying conclusion, and its eleventh-hour attempts to suddenly announce what it’s all about seem a little desperate. Even though it doesn’t stick the landing, The Good Life offers players a chance to visit a charming town full of interesting people and take part in one of the chillest, most relaxing open world adventure games ever. It’s not a masterpiece but it’s certainly worth the trip, even for those not obsessed with SWERY’s work."
5136,293,The Good Life,70,TheSixthAxis,"Nov  1, 2021","The Good Life is another flawed yet fascinating gem from Swery65. It's a weird world full of unforgettable characters, and even when the gameplay grows a bit tiring or repetitive, it's worth all the photo quests and fetch missions in the world to see that next bonkers twist in the story."
5137,293,The Good Life,70,Wccftech,"Oct 14, 2021","The Good Life comes with excellent narrative elements, but the entire experience is damaged by some weird design choices that result in mediocre gameplay. While this is hardly surprising for a game directed by SWERY, some of the ideas featured in The Good Life, like the cat and dog transformation mechanics, deserved a much better execution, as they feel shallow and not particularly interesting. With such flawed gameplay, only die-hard fans of the Japanese director will truly love The Good Life."
5138,293,The Good Life,70,Game Informer,"Oct 14, 2021","In spite of its lack of polish, I enjoyed The Good Life. It has some rough edges, but these can contribute to its charm, and it’s undeniably entertaining when the story is purposely silly or when I had time to just breathe in the world. The Good Life has heart, even if its features don’t always work together and its design holds it back."

5140,293,The Good Life,60,GameSpot,"Oct 26, 2021","The Good Life is a curious and uneven experience. As a sort of hybrid RPG meets life-sim, it's certainly competent, despite the grind it demands. Surprisingly, the novel premise takes a back seat for the most part, but it's never anything less than adorably easy-going, carried along by a carefree attitude and endless charm."
5141,293,The Good Life,60,Noisy Pixel,"Oct 21, 2021","If you can get through the fetch quests and borderline walking simulator elements, then The Good Life has an intriguing narrative for you to unravel and enjoy.

I certainly enjoyed parts of it, and some of its stranger moments really do land as big, enjoyable peaks. But there’s a lot of valley in-between, and while I arrived in Rainy Woods eager for a pleasant countryside escape, I didn’t feel like making a return trip after the credits had rolled."
5143,293,The Good Life,59,Riot Pixels,"Jan 22, 2022","The developers seem to revel in their weak game design as if saying, “Yes, we know that our quests are atrocious, enjoy!” No interesting conversations, no stories, just emptiness decorated with mediocre puns and overly dumb situations. The same emptiness permeates the main storyline, which riffs on age-old cliches featuring UFOs, Nazis, Sherlock Holmes and medieval poems. There is no thought behind this madness, and all these quirky characters don’t come off as actual people."
5144,293,The Good Life,58,IGN Italia,"Oct 14, 2021",The Good Life is Swery's first take on the Life simulators genre. While it incorporates all the features that made him a cult creator it also shows a disorienting mix of elements and mechanics that just don't work well together. The thin narrative line and the histrionic cast of characters fail to fully flesh out the social commentary that the creator intended to convey. The whole experience ends up feeling more like a list of chores rather than a smart and enjoyable experience in Swery's characteristic Troma-like fashion.

I found the town of Rainy Woods and its mysteries engaging enough to want to see the experience through to the end. There are so many nuggets of potential that are held back by irritating health meters and repetitive side quests. If you’re a fan of SWERY’s previous output or have a lot of patience for fetch quests, there is reason enough to check out The Good Life, but it is a hard sell for pretty much anyone else."
5147,293,The Good Life,50,The Indie Game Website,"Oct 20, 2021","I love bad games. But The Good Life doesn’t fall into this category of bad-fun, it’s simply too much of a mess. Did anyone say no to anything in the course of refining the core concept of this game? Probably not. Is it even fun? I still don’t know because even after 8 to 10 hours, I feel stuck between a begrudging sense of sunk-cost fallacy and possible Stockholm syndrome as someone who also once faced ruinous debt and an unwanted move. Honestly, there’s no such thing as a good life unless you have paws, eat garbage and can pee freely in public, but you don’t need to play this game to know that."

The new music-lookup monster creation system is a much needed modernization for the series, the FF Mode is a great way to quickly grind out your monster’s stats, but I fear that multiplayer may be a letdown. I sincerely hope that these remasters pave the way for a modern Monster Rancher installment, because if these remasters are any indication, Koei Tecmo are on the right track."

If you're new to Monster Rancher, this is a nice way to get into the series assuming you're ok with some dated mechanics and visuals, but are willing to try something unique."

The big take away is that these games have not aged particularly well. Mechanically, it’s rough around the edges, at least within the battle system. Raising a monster is one of the more compelling components as fans of micromanaging time and effort will have a blast. The disc system, or lack thereof now, is disappointing as it becomes a gaccha reroll machine that takes out the fun of picking up what you have around and using it. Granted, it’s hard to actually simulate a system that cannot be done today, but it’s just not the same. In the end, Monster Rancher 1 & 2 DX has done enough to justify the revisit of two of the most memorable monster games."

However, this pair of titles is truly a product of its time: a lack of tutorials, janky graphics, and a set of opaque gameplay systems reliant on heavy grinding might prove too high a barrier for the average creature collector. Pick this up only if you’re prepared for a nostalgic romp through the highs and lows of late nineties game design."
5156,294,Monster Rancher 1 & 2 DX,60,Eurogamer Italy,"Dec  9, 2021","Monster Rancher 1&2 DX is a controversial operation.

5157,294,Monster Rancher 1 & 2 DX,20,NME,"Dec  8, 2021","The best that can be said about Monster Rancher 1 & 2 DX is that it’s an interesting time capsule, a snapshot of how different monster-catching games could get at the turn of the millennium. Unfortunately, stripped of its most interesting mechanic and lazily dropped onto PC as an almost entirely unaltered mobile game, a snapshot of the past is all most players will want from this. There’s only so far that nostalgia can drive players, and this is more likely to poison memories than spark fond remembrances."

At some point, however, repetition and fatigue with the one-note approach to pacing and the relentlessly hopeless nature of the world set in.

But its tedious, unsatisfying combat, janky animations, and AI that’s prone to mess up all test your patience without offering any tangible reward. It misses out on making you feel like a bounty hunter – badass or otherwise – and all you’re left with, in case you do play through its campaign, is a sense that you could have spent that time playing something better."

It does so by building an almost convincing narrative structure, without skimping on the crude representation of sex and violence, managing to maintain a difficult balance with all the other components of the game. The technical quality, however, is fluctuating, with 3D models that seem to come out of some game 20 years ago, animations at the limit of decency and sudden ""coughs"" of the script."

Lust from Beyond is a decent adventure, for sure, with a neat dose of Lovecraft in it as well. While it has its moments, it isn't really very effecting at being scary of discomforting, with the gameplay certainly being the least enjoyable aspect of it all. It's easy to find a lot worse in the realm of indie horror games, so if a big fan of the genre, do try it out if you get the chance to find it really cheap, just don't expect something that will stay with you for long."

I cared about Squad Three and wanted them to succeed, and for a narrative-driven game such as this, isn't that all you can ask for? If postapocalyptic survival games are your jam, Ashwalkers is worth its very reasonable $12 price tag and offers a different spin on the genre that you know and love."

5211,297,Ashwalkers: A Survival Journey,80,Hey Poor Player,"Apr 19, 2021","Ashwalkers toes a fine line between survival and story and does a great job of it. The storytelling is just enough to tease out a unique ashy apocalypse without getting burdened by too many specifics, while the survival aspect is stressful but not impossible to overcome. While playing, I found myself invested in not only the Squad’s survival but the fate of those 250,000 souls back in the Citadel, only satisfied once I got an ending with a hopeful note. If you enjoyed the scouting section of Frostpunk and wanted to see that mechanic expanded upon, look no further than Ashwalkers."

It’s not going to knock anyone’s socks off, but I did enjoy my time with the game even if it did have a few moments where it frustrated me. This one is for the story fans. Not actually the survival players. If you’re looking for a choice driven game, you’ll get it here. If you’re looking for a post-apocalyptic survival game, you’ll need to look elsewhere."
5215,297,Ashwalkers: A Survival Journey,75,Softpedia,"Apr 15, 2021","Ashwalkers has a few good ideas that it executes well. The problem is that the development team wants to make the game seem to be more than it actually is. If everything moved faster and with clearer decisions then it would be worth an extended time investment. As it stands after a first completed expedition I had no desire to try another. The characters stay the same and the management element never adds new twists. The end screen for each playthrough shows quite a few possible conclusions to work towards but the world never feels interesting enough to try and get them all. Unless you truly love slow, moody stories and choice-focused titles avoid Ashwalkers unless updates deliver a tighter, faster version of the experience."

I was always curious whether I was making the right choices and getting my team closer to their goal, or if I was sending them to their deaths. Seeing how even the smallest of choices can affect the playthrough was rewarding, and the mystery of the Dome of Domes is worth a trek through the wastes for any fan of survival management and choice-based games."

Its heavy material and its dreary art style doesn't make it a game that I plan to revisit very often. I can appreciate the variety of scenarios, especially the idea that players can select different starting points after multiple playthroughs. In that sense, it's unlike a lot of survival games out today and worth playing through at least once."
5220,297,Ashwalkers: A Survival Journey,70,Noisy Pixel,"Apr 15, 2021","Ashwalkers provides a great first impression through its atmosphere and mechanics, but each playthrough weighs on that experience. The repetitive nature of this adventure simply has you playing until you wear yourself out after so many of the different endings are similar to each other.

5221,297,Ashwalkers: A Survival Journey,65,GamingTrend,"Apr 16, 2021","While Ashwalkers has an interesting art style and atmosphere, it does little to capitalize on its survival mechanics, choice based narrative, and is far too easy for what it wants to be.

5222,297,Ashwalkers: A Survival Journey,60,COGconnected,"Apr 29, 2021","As it stands I finished the game without a lot of desire to repeat the journey to flesh out the many endings (34 in total). Because while there are enjoyable moments, it’s spread across a sparse and long hallway to move through. Ashwalkers has the bones of some good ideas. I’m hoping to see more from this studio as there are unique things to be found here, Nameless XIII just never really hits their mark. There are plenty of walking simulators out there that make you forget what they are. Ashwalkers, unfortunately, is not one of them."

Ashwalkers led me to identify with the arduousness of its quest–a sadly drab journey overly invested in its destination, with more interesting moments spread out like notable landmarks. This sparsity left me wanting for more to grapple with here and now, rather than the promise of unlocking it later. The latter, it seems, feels like a gambit that doesn’t pay off."
5224,297,Ashwalkers: A Survival Journey,60,Screen Rant,"Apr 15, 2021","Ashwalkers is still a fascinating little narrative experience. There's an interesting and at times surprisingly uplifting world to explore, and it's worth playing through the game multiple times to see where its branching pathways lead. That said, its brevity means that there's not quite enough meat on the bones to really envelop anyone in its atmosphere, which could leave some explorers wanting more."
5225,297,Ashwalkers: A Survival Journey,60,TheSixthAxis,"Apr 15, 2021","The core game of Ashwalkers is a great, atmospheric experience that takes classics like The Oregon Trail and transports them to a vividly realised post-apocalyptic setting. Characters are nicely defined, resource management is clearly presented, and I genuinely wanted to find out more about the world and its inhabitants. However, the actual process of playing the game is just too slow and becomes boring after the first couple of runs. There is a good survival and choice-filled game here, but you have to walk a long long way to get to it."

Through the added feature of expedition parties and combat, Sheltered 2’s gameplay feels varied and engaging overall. While its user interface can be complex and overwhelming at times and its aspects of micromanagement might not be for everyone, if you’re a strategy aficionado who’s not deterred by numbers, there’s plenty to love in Sheltered 2."

The complex combination of social elements and individual character needs, mixed with the survival genre mechanics of exploration, crafting, and base-building, create a brutal survival setting. However, due to the number of elements players will be juggling, those who prefer single-character survival titles may find Sheltered 2's gameplay to be overwhelming. Despite this, Sheltered 2 offers a rewarding challenge for fans of apocalyptic survival games and is a nice change from survival titles focused on combat and base looting."
5237,298,Sheltered 2,68,COGconnected,"Sep 27, 2021","The bright side is, the strategy layer of Sheltered 2 is better than ever. If this kind of game is your jam and the original flew under your radar, it’s worth checking out. And if you played the original to death (as I did) and you’re looking for a reason to fall back into it, think of this as a sort of pricey update. If that doesn’t repel you, Sheltered 2 is just fine. Or maybe that sounds really appealing to you. Despite some of the underwhelming changes, I anticipate putting a lot more time into Sheltered 2. The core gameplay is just that appealing. That makes Sheltered 2 a game where the core mechanic is strong, but none of the set dressing is all that exciting."

The complexity of the Unicode title is really high and only a niche of players will be able to appreciate the whole package without giving up at the first difficulties.

The developers have staked everything on the amount of different mechanics without paying too much attention to mixing them in the right way and the result is a chaotic experience, not very user friendly and too punitive."

It seems easy enough until the pages and pages of information pop-ups appear, expecting players to remember everything immediately or else get stuck. I'd describe it as a cognitive nightmare. Back at the beginning of this review, I wondered if adding factions is enough to change the middle reviews that Sheltered received. In my case, it does not. It's fun enough in a sim/management way, but the post-apocalyptic thing has been repeated what feels like infinitely and lacks originality, and factions just complicate the game to the point there's no more room in my brain for information to remain there. There is very little to become emotionally attached to. The result? A middling review."

It’s fun if you liked the original Sheltered, or Fallout Shelter, and in many ways, it’s an upgrade of those apocalypse bunker sims. The issue, however, is that despite all of the game’s improvements and complexities, its overambition is also its biggest downfall. The core mechanics of its basic survival necessities of maintaining food and water are at the moment glitched, and any progress is meaningless because it will inevitably lead to a time-wasted end where resources inevitably run out two weeks in. As of right now, there are no ways of replenishing water save for bartering (if you’re lucky enough to find a faction with spare water), and so because of this, I can’t give this broken game a positive review. With some updates to fix the bugs and polish off the post-apocalyptic dirt from this potential jewel, Sheltered 2 might be able to fulfil its lofty ambitions."

Its main story arc of finding a prom date for its hero Coop works well as a narrative thread to hold together all manner of tasteless nonsense. The game is being advertised as the first of a trilogy and has enough to see and interact with to satisfy its core audience. The relatively low price and time investment of around ten hours are inviting, but I suspect the subject matter and confounding frustrations brought on by genre design tropes will put off the general gaming audience at large. Easy to recommend to Cyanide & Happiness fans, but all others should check out the comics before proceeding."

The combat is a mess in need of a significant overhaul, the UI is fussy and unhelpful, and a string of bugs and puzzle roadblocks kill any sense of momentum.

5274,301,THE SHORE,40,Screen Rant,"Mar  8, 2021","The Shore Lighthouse Level

The Cthulhu Mythos has been around for years in the world of literature, movies, and gaming. Indie developer Ares Dragonis has released its first game set in this horror lore steeped with excellent adaptations in The Shore. Combining exploration, puzzle-solving, and a first-person narrative, The Shore takes players on a mysterious journey to find their lost daughter who went missing on an island. Everything seems normal enough until the protagonist begins finding cryptic letters scattered all around the island, leading them deeper into the Lovecraft-world of monsters and madness.

The overall gameplay of The Shore consists of players searching the island for clues and trinkets to unlock other areas of the game. It feels and plays very much like any other classic exploration game. Here is where issues begin to rise out of the depths much like a slumbering monster shaking off sleep: invisible walls are everywhere, and it is never truly clear visually where the player can and cannot go in the early levels of the game. When getting started, players can only walk at an incredibly slow speed, or hold the shift key to walk slightly faster. This certainly helps players take in the visual environment of The Shore but becomes increasingly frustrating when navigating through its world.

The Shore does begin to ramp up a bit once players get through the initial Lighthouse level, offering puzzles that range from overtly obvious to incredibly frustrating. There are never many clues at where to go next and the constant invisible walls created some solutions requiring players to ""find the gap"" that allows them to continue. Eventually, The Shore allows players to jump using the space bar, but this ability only unlocks at the point the player needs it. That seems to be a common thread in this game - players start with practically nothing, then when an ability is needed to progress the game simply unlocks it.
The Shore Cthulhu Awakening

The Shore isn't all puzzles and walking , as there are creatures out to kill the player, and they will almost surely die many times. Almost every creature reveal is done to create a jump-scare, and with zero knowledge of what to do to combat, or run away from, the abominations, there's a cycle of every creature reveal essentially forcing at least one player death. The Shore relies on trial and error from the player but doesn't pull it off in a positive way like Super Meat Boy or Little Nightmares 2 does.

Where developer Ares Dragonis' project truly begins to shine is in its visuals. The island and outer worlds of The Shore are amazing landscapes to see. Nothing ever feels like cheap repeated textures, and even the rocks that make up the island all look unique. The overall creature design is spectacular and truly creates the feeling of giant Elder Gods coming to destroy the Earth. This game is a nightmare-scape that truly pulls off the look of Lovecraft design.

Aesthetic aside, it's hard to forgive The Shore of its many downfalls. Slow pacing and unintuitive puzzles really hurt this beautiful game and turn it from horror exploration into a horrifyingly frustrating walking-sim. The lore of the Cthulhu Mythos is well represented, and the story is an interesting one, but getting over the hurdles of bad gameplay is a road into madness that should be reserved only for those who love the universe this game was built upon."

It is an achievement that one person managed to develop most of the game on their own, but that is not an element that should be taken into account when speaking of the quality. The gameplay is stripped back for simplicity, which is a double-edged sword for Tasomachi: Behind the Twilight. The challenge is never truly there, and the limited amount of challenge rooms means the game never gets the time to flesh out more intricate platforming designs, leaving it with a lack of variation. Still, when it was all coming together, I was enjoying the game, its lovely art style, its sort of tranquillity state when the music hits and the platforming is in full swing as it can be. It might not be a memorable platform game, but Tasomachi: Behind the Twilight is a fair starting block, a sort of alpha test that could be made into something much bigger, deeper and better in a sequel."

In some ways Lost Ruins is a proper testament to the classics, they were just so much more nuanced than their visuals let on.

Yes, it has waifu bosses with big bouncy assets, and they drop swimsuits as the reward, but to be perfectly honest this isn't the main thing here. Actual effort has been made during this title's creation, with the fanservice (or whatever you want to call it) being just the cherry on top of it all.

The unfortunate reality however is that the performance is currently letting it down. Serious optimisation work is a necessity to iron out a multitude of issues - albeit it's probably not as bad as some are portraying in the immediate aftermath of release. While the new gameplay mechanics come with some variety for those bored of simple space combat, the shooting on the ground also needs a good deal of attention, with AI, and the general standard of combat, alongside the amount of different locations generated on planets, all in need of work.

Every system presented to the player works on a functional level, but their implementation simply isn’t up to par with what’s required to make an engaging video game—even one that’s only about four hours long—and this culminates in an experience that ends up being more half-baked than hard-boiled."

It's hard not to think about the games that this trilogy would inspire--stuff like Mafia, Saints Row, Yakuza, Sleeping Dogs--and how well each of those series have been preserved and updated.

Although it's an adaptation of a board game, you might as well call it a ""bored game"" due to the tedium and frustration you'll experience."
5476,317,Arkham Horror: Mother's Embrace,39,4Players.de,"Mar 30, 2021","This version of the beloved board game is horrific for all the wrong reasons. There is no atmosphere, no horror, no tension, nothing."
5477,318,Of Bird and Cage,85,Vgames,"May 20, 2021","I applaud Capricia Productions, they have managed to capture exactly what they’ve wanted in this game and more. The soundtrack, which is the real highlight here, comes with some of the biggest names in the metal genre, and it’s done so well."
5478,318,Of Bird and Cage,70,Hey Poor Player,"May 26, 2021","This dark depiction of Beauty and the Beast works, but only if you recognize what you’re getting into: a musical experience focusing on an abused psyche desperately trying to break free from known shackles, only to fly right into a cage that represents both prison and freedom."
5479,318,Of Bird and Cage,60,Softpedia,"May 20, 2021","Of Bird and Cage is not a good game and I can only think of a small subset of people who might enjoy it: fans of progressive rock with a love of soapy narrative drive titles and an ability to ignore presentation issues. Anyone else should avoid playing the game, even if it is relatively short at around two hours. The developers are certainly attempting an ambitious mix and they should be applauded for that. But a lot more investment in coherent gameplay and a good story is required to make it a success. Get the soundtrack created for Of Bird and Cage if you love the artists involved because it really does not work as a video game."
5480,318,Of Bird and Cage,50,Player 2,"Jun 22, 2021","Combining the operatic aspects into a video game means that the viewer becomes an actor and divides the attention of the player between trying to figure out what they have to do and what is going on in the rest of the scene.  It is a balancing act that the team at Capricia Productions have not quite managed to overcome, and yet I want to see what they can do with the format in the future."
5481,318,Of Bird and Cage,50,Gamer Escape,"May 21, 2021","It’s not only the kind of game that you can finish in an afternoon, it’s also the kind that doesn’t leave much of an impression on you after the fact. While it’s able to roll down the road, it’s doing so holding things together with zip ties and a dream. It’s the kind of hot mess where the best experience would be to just give the album a listen on Spotify, because everything else just doesn’t do it justice."
5482,318,Of Bird and Cage,45,The Indie Game Website,"May 26, 2021","I suspect Of Bird and Cage works best as an album first, and maybe a speed runner video as a distant second. Perhaps by the end Gritta escapes her prison and finds the support she needs to reclaim the light of her life in one of the possible endings, but given the oppressively deep hole she starts in, I’m not convinced that the game believes she deserves it. Though she most certainly does."
5483,318,Of Bird and Cage,40,Hooked Gamers,"Jul 20, 2021","Writing a negative review can feel cathartic when it’s in response to lazy, sleazy, or greedy game design, but this isn’t one of those reviews. Of Bird and Cage is very clearly a passion project that aims to do something new and exciting, and, while it does a few things very well, it just doesn’t have a solid enough foundation to make it fun to play. I love the music and I like the story that they were trying to tell, but sloppy game mechanics, poorly developed narrative beats, and disappointing visuals make this a game I can’t recommend for most."
5484,318,Of Bird and Cage,40,GameCritics,"Jul 15, 2021","In the end, Of Bird and Cage left me with a terrible taste in my mouth, and I wondered how it managed to get released today. In fact, it’s so bad that I would almost recommend it to connoisseurs of terrible games, but frankly, I’m not sure I could live with my conscience."
5485,318,Of Bird and Cage,30,CD-Action,"Jul 23, 2021","The concept of an experimental, interactive music album was great, and the fact that musicians associated with Epica, Within Temptation, Kamelot or Asking Alexandria were involved, was very promising and impressive. Unfortunately, the game turned out to be an amateurish mess. The whole gameplay is very poorly executed, the story is cheap and approaches difficult subjects without a trace of finesse, and the voice acting is simply horrible. The worst part is, the music is okay at best. [08/2021, p.54]"
5486,318,Of Bird and Cage,30,Checkpoint Gaming,"May 28, 2021","As a game, it is not up to scratch. While the characters and the story might be good enough for a music video, it’s not good enough for a video game. It is clear these are music video characters, sometimes in great emotional scenes, but often feeling two dimensional. The gameplay is sometimes nice, but often lacking in a discernable thread of logic, and is undercut when you see how little influence you have on what is clearly a prescribed set of events."
5487,318,Of Bird and Cage,30,Multiplayer.it,"May 24, 2021",Of Bird and Cage has only one problem: it is terribly done. Leave the poor Gitta alone with her misery.
5488,318,Of Bird and Cage,20,KeenGamer,"May 28, 2021","Of Bird and Cage is an interesting idea fatally flawed in almost every aspect of its execution. It ultimately fails to reach even “so bad it’s good” status due to poorly thought out and implemented mechanics wrapped in a visual and narrative tedium. Too clunky to appeal to gamers and too incoherent to impress newcomers, it lands nowhere and looks sloppy while doing so. The few moments where everything clicks into place are few and far between."
5489,318,Of Bird and Cage,20,Screen Rant,"May 20, 2021","Of Bird and Cage is probably one of the most experimental video games to release in recent memory, but just because a game is unique doesn't necessarily mean that it's worth playing. Heavy metal fans are better off picking up an album from their favorite band, and those who love interactive story games should stick to the best of the Telltale games and their ilk. Of Bird and Cage struggles at nearly everything it sets out to do, and its few interesting songs can't save an ultimately disjointed and unremarkable experience."
5490,319,Balan Wonderworld,65,Atomix,"Mar 30, 2021","Balan Wonderworld feels like a platformer game from 20 years ago, with outdated mechanics, controls and a horrible costume mechanic which locks the player out of many collectibles way too soon."
5491,319,Balan Wonderworld,62,TierraGamer,"Apr  1, 2021","From afar, Balan Wonderworld looks amazing and charming, but as soon as you get a little closer, its magic is lost. Balan Wonderworld got stuck in the nostalgia and success that Sonic and Nights into Dreams had during their prime. It does not take risks and its creativity falls short."
5492,319,Balan Wonderworld,60,PC Invasion,"Mar 29, 2021","Painfully average in most respects, Balan Wonderworld won't draw much admiration for its contents. Still, it's a competent game that does have its charms, few as they may be."
5493,319,Balan Wonderworld,45,CD-Action,"Nov 19, 2021","Around the middle of the campaign Balan Wonderworld suddenly gets its act together and becomes almost enjoyable, but the first half is a discouraging display of awful level design and overall ineptitude. [06/2021, p.40]"
5494,319,Balan Wonderworld,45,Merlin'in Kazanı (Turkey),"Apr  7, 2021","Balan Wonderworld is a mid-level platform game that looks great, has great music but its potential was largely wasted."
5495,319,Balan Wonderworld,40,IGN,"Mar 30, 2021","Balan Wonderworld isn’t always an awful platformer, but it is a consistently boring one. It’s full of charming character designs and the occasional hint of a clever idea, but its insistence on being a one-button game with dozens of needlessly overlapping abilities that are thrown aside just as fast as they are introduced rots it to the core. It’s a mess of undercooked concepts and clunky mechanics that slow it to a crawl, and it seems to take inspiration from better games without properly recapturing what actually makes them fun. Its platforming never evolves beyond the most basic possible obstacles it can throw at you, but it's the fundamentally flawed choices behind that mediocrity that take Balan Wonderworld from unamusing to outright bad."
5496,319,Balan Wonderworld,30,Gfinity,"Apr  5, 2021","Balan Wonderworld gets no standing ovation for me – not even a clap. In fact, get your tomatoes at the ready for this musical theatre flop because as much as I wanted to like Balan Wonderworld (and believe me, I really wanted to like it) this game gets more than a few boos from me. With basic platforming, the removal of a jump button, and a distinct lack of challenge, there's little to recommend here."
5497,319,Balan Wonderworld,30,GameSkinny,"Mar 30, 2021","Balan Wonderworld tries to be an homage to nostalgic platformers from the PS2 era, but it forgets to be a good game in the process."
5498,319,Balan Wonderworld,20,Het Nieuwsblad,"Apr 22, 2021","Playing Balan Wonderworld is like looking forward to a virtuous hot shower after a long and hard day of work, only to find that there is only cold water: a big and unfortunate disappointment."
5499,319,Balan Wonderworld,20,GamesBeat,"Apr 13, 2021","Balan Wonderworld is a $60 game, but I wouldn’t recommend it for even $10. It oscillates between boring and infuriating. The most fun I had with it was when I got costumes that made it feel almost on par with a mediocre Sega Dreamcast platformer in terms of capabilities. The kindest thing I can say about the game is that it does make for an entertaining livestream. I broadcasted my play on Twitch, and my audience seemed to really enjoy watching me suffer. So I guess this is a great one for all those fans of masochism out there. Let’s call it The Room of video games."
5500,319,Balan Wonderworld,20,CGMagazine,"Apr 11, 2021","Balan Wonderworld is just plain bad. Apart from its terrible costume system, it does nothing new and just poorly copies things that other 3D platformers have already done better."
5501,320,eFootball 2022,30,GameGrin,"Oct 25, 2021","eFootball 2022 isn’t just a bad football game, it’s a bad videogame. It took Konami most of the 2010s to take Pro Evolution Soccer from a mediocre football game to something respectable, and can’t be expected to turn eFootball 2022 around quickly. Playing it sucked all of the enjoyment out of football, and I can’t help but feel it would have been better served being released as a digital pachinko game."
5502,320,eFootball 2022,30,TrueGaming,"Oct 18, 2021","This is a solid football game like the series has always been, but the lack of content and game modes simply means there is nothing to do in this game. You will get bored in a matter of hours."
5503,320,eFootball 2022,30,PC Gamer,"Oct 13, 2021","In PR terms, it's the world's costliest public beta. There's a lithe control system in the wreckage, but it'll take many updates to dig it out."
5504,320,eFootball 2022,28,GameStar,"Oct 10, 2021","It's the worst-rated game on Steam for a reason, soccer fans are left
heartbroken."
5505,320,eFootball 2022,20,Gamer.no,"Oct 10, 2021","The game is straight up horrible, and I can’t understand how someone concluded that this was ready for release."
5506,320,eFootball 2022,20,PC Games,"Oct  5, 2021","The Pro Evolution Soccer series was all the time a worthy opponent for the popular football simulation FIFA. But the newest game from Konami eFootball 2022 has lost all of its glory of the past. The biggest problem of the title is not the small scope with only two gamemodes, nine licensed clubs and six stadiums, it’s the horrendous gameplay. The switch to the Unreal Engine does absolutely not work for the new football simulation from Konami. There is a lot of work to do in the next weeks, to make this game enjoyable and playable."
5507,320,eFootball 2022,10,Screen Rant,"Oct  3, 2021","eFootball 2022 is a disaster at launch. It's a buggy, unenjoyable mess with limited gameplay options that strip back the core strengths of the PES series, and the fact that it was released in this state at all is shocking. Konami may bring in fixes as it implements further free-to-play updates, but even then, the question over eFootball 2022's worth will still need to be repeatedly asked."
